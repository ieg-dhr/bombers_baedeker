PREPACK
1,The 1944 edition of the "Bcmber's Baed revised and amplified version of Part III edition,which it replaces. It has been scope to cover all towns in Germany (re which are of any industrial significance, and it has been possible to expand the number of industrial establishments listed in each town. Information relating to the activities of particular factories has been revised in the light of the latest available intelligence.
2.As in the previous edition, enterprises have been grouped under fourteen industrial headings as follows:-
1.Transportation
2.Public Utility Services
3.Solid Fuels
4.Liquid Riels & Substitutes%
5.Iron, Steel, & Ferro-Alloys
6.Non-Ferrous Metal Smelting, Refining,
A Manufacture
7.Aircraft & Aero-engines
8.Shipbuilding
9.Othei' Engineering and Armament Industries
10.Chemicals & Explosives
11.Textiles, Rayon, Pulp & Paper
12.Rubber & Tyres
13.Leather
14.Food industries
3.The descriptions of activities and the figures in the column entitled "Priority" are intended only as a general guide to the size and relative importance of the individual undertakings. The basis on which the "Priority" ratings have been allotted is as follows:-
1+Factories ofoutstanding importance
in the German war effort.
1Major plantsin major industries
2Minor plantsin major industries
$
or
Major plantsin minor industries
3Factories ofrelatively small
importance in the German war effort.

Factories which are almost certainly of little importance in the German war effort and establishments concerning which the available information is not sufficient to enable any priority rating to be allotted.
Some of the works included without priority are new establishments the activities of which are uncertain; some of them would doubtless rank for inclusion in one of the four priority groups if full information were available.
In allotting priorities account has been taken of the damage inflicted in area attack only in cases where the productivity of the factory concerned appears to have been permanently affected. In other cases factories are assessed on the basis that they have been fully repaired and are fully active. Owing to the speed with which repairs are put in nand in Borne cases, it did not seem practicable to give weight to damage which may prove to be temporary in assessing priorities which are intended for long-term reference.
The priority rating of a factory in the Bomber's Baedeker consequently does not neoessarily reflect its current importance and should not be used for the purpose of appreciations without reference to its current damage status. If the demand from users justifies it, however, periodical statements can be issued to show the current status of damaged factories as well as other amendments.
4.Owing to its increased size it eras been necessary to bind the new edition in two parts, of which the first includes,
in alphabetical order, the towns AACHEN to KÜSTRIN; and the second the towns LAHR to ZVICKAU.
Each part is accompanied by maps showing: -
a)All towns covered by the 1944 edition of the Bomber's BaedeKer.
b)The method of division of the industriell area of the Ruhr into fourteen districts.
An index is in course of preparation.

AACHEN (Rhineland)
50° 47' N. 6° 5' E: 275 miles: (164,000)
Aachen is an important railway junction on one of the main routes from North -West Germany into Belgium and Prance . It is the centre of
a large coal -mining area * and many of the companies exploiting these
mines have their administrative offices in the town . In peace - time
textiles formed the main industry in Aachen proper . There are a large number of spinning and weaving mills , many of which were closed early
in the war. The leading firms of Aachen 's engineering and rubber
industry are mentioned below . The town has been heavily damaged by bombing , and the production of several of these firms reduced , but much of the industrial damage , particularly to the main factories , has been repaired . The industries are mainly grouped in the North East corner
of the town along the JtLLicherstrasse , and in the Rothe Brde district,
east of the town centre . Several of the textile mills in the Jdlicher- strasse , which have been closed down, are now said to be used as
dummies . The central part of the town is closely built , and has largely preserved its mediaeval character.

PRIORITY RATING
The main line Westwards from Cologne passes round the Southern edge of the town centre and crosses an important viaduct immediately to the East of the main railway station . At this station the line divides , one branch leading to Verviers and Liege , 25 miles
West of Aachen , and the second leading Northwards round the town centre to the
Aachen -West Station , near to which , a second important track leads by another route to
Liege . Prom the Aachen -West Station , a main line leads North East to Krefeld and
the Ruhr. These are the trunk lines which ^ connect the industrial Rhineland direct with
Antwerp and, through the Meuse valley , with North Eastern Prance . Further important branch lines lead from Aachen North East to
Maastricht and Holland , and , from the Nord- bahnhof Station , to Jtllioh and the coal mining region to the North East of the town.

BERLIN
52° 30' N. 13° 20' E: 580 miles: (4,400,000)
General Introduction
Berlin, the capital of the German Reich, and the third largest city in the world, is not only the political and economic adminis-Itrative centre of Germany, but ranks also as the most important
industrial and manufacturing city on the Continent of Europe,
The suburbs and built-up area extends from East to nest for some 20 miles, and from North to South approximately 17 miles. The administrative boundaries have been extended by the inclusion of surrounding districts to give a total area of 345 square miles.
The chief industrial areas lie firstly, to the North-west, including Spandau, Siemenstadt, Wedding, Tegel, and Reinickendorf, and secondly, to the South and South-east including Marienfelde, Tempelhof, and Johannistal, There are other well-established industrial areas, such as Lichtenberg and SchBneberg, which are respectively in the eastern and southern quarters of the city.
Further industrial extension is taking place in various outlying portions of the administrative area.
The course of the river Spree, which is navigable, runs approximately from South-east to North-west through the centre of the city.
At Spandau it joins the Havel, which flows from North to South along the western border of Berlin. The Teltow canal, which leaves the Spree near Treptow and runs through the Southern outskirts of Greater Berlin, Joins the Havel near Potsdam and forms a link to relieve the water-borne traffic through the centre of the city.
Great use has been made of the waterways around Berlin in order to connect the capital with the Elbe and the Oder. Large inland harbours have been constructed. The most important of which is the Westhafen, where 70 large ships can be loaded simultaneously. The Westhafen is connected with the Spree and with the Havel, which it ''Joins at Spandau. From the Havel (North-west of Berlin) ship
canals have been built giving direct access in the East to the Oder, and in the West to the Elbe. By this means navigable waterways connect Berlin directly with Stettin and the Baltic, and with Hamburg.
The main railway artery between Western and North-eastern Europe runs through Berlin. There are three large railway stations (';on this East to West line. In addition main lines radiate from five
other terminal railway stations to all parts of Germany. The local and suburban traffic is served by the electric Stadt- und Ringbahn, the extensive network of which extends over the whole area. This is supplemented by the large system of the Hoch- und Untergrundbahn, which runs partly underground and partly a3 an elevated railway, and ' by the tramway and bus services.
All the leading firms have administrative offices in Berlin.
These are largely concentrated in the central city area between Alexanderplatz and the Eastern end of Unter den Linden, and also in the neighbourhood of the Potsdamnerplatz.
Running South frcm the Western end of Unter den Linden is the Wilhelmstrasse, in which are situated the Chancellery, the War Office, the Air Ministry and other Government departments.

The principal shopping centres of Be:lin, which contain several large department stores, are Leipzigerstrasse, Alexanderplatz, and Tauentzienstrasse, in Charlottenburg.
Industries

The firmly established and significant position held by the industries of Berlin within the German productive machine is primarily due to their scope and diversity, both of which have been further developed during the war.
The electro-technical industry (including radio) still maintains its important and leading position and is represented by large firms of world-wide repute such as the A.E. G., Siemens & Halske A.G,,
Siemens Sehuckert A. G., and Teiefunken Ges. fur Drahtlose Telegraphie nub.H, Osram G.nub.H., and others.
The general engineering industry is also of substantial importance, as is shown by the well-known firms engaged in it, such as Rheinmetall Borsig A.G., Ambi-Budd Presswerke G.nub.H., Deutsche Industriewerke A.G., Berliner Maschinenbau A. G. (vomals L.Schwartzkopff), and Daimler-Benz A.G.; it is, in fact, Berlin's second-largest branch of industry' The aircraft industry is represented by B. It. '.'/.,
Domier, Heinkel.and Focke-Wulf, and general engineering by numerous makers of precision tool and of precision and optical instruments.
Berlin's chemical, clothing, and food industries, are also of more than local importance.
Industrial Areas
The chief industrial areas are located outside the Ringbahn, along the water and railway routes. These routes are arranged in three main belts:- the river Spree and the canals associated with it; the railway wliieh encircles the outskirts of the compact built-up area, i. e., the Ringbahn; and an outer ring of communications which consist of the Havel and 'fcgel See to the West, the Teltow canal from Potsdam to Köpenick to the South, and the Industrie Bahn to the North from Tegel to Lichtenberg.
An important fen ‘v re of the three outstanding industrial areas is that the'- _ onxy small residential areas in their immediate vicinity. In order of importance these are:-
(1)Spandau. C nrlottenburg, and Sicne.nstadt.
This \ve3t-central part of Berlin i3 of the highest importance.
Here there are very big blocks of factory buildings and also a special port. Among others, the electrical equipnent and cable •.works of Siemens & Halske A.G., Siemens Sehuckert A.G., A.E. G. Turbinenfabrik, the Ges. fur Elektrische Unternehmungen L.Loewe A. G. , Osran G.n.b.H,, and the 3. 'A W. are located there. The second and third largest of the BEWAG power stations are also in this area.
(2)Treptow and Sonor' ev.rtde.
The manufacture of electrical equipment of all kinds is predominant within this are , and, although the A.E.C. lias its largest individual plant at Brunnenstiasse, Wadding, the three most important electrical equipment and cable works of the company are to be found here. The most important of Berlin's non-ferrous metal plants and the main works of the important Accumulatorcn Fabrik A.G. (A. F. A. )

axe located in the Sch&neweide district. There are other engineering works, motor vehicle and metal works. The largest of the 3EWAG power stations is at Rummelshurg, near the Treptow area,
(3) Tegel, Wittenau, and Reinickendorf.
Important engineering and armamer.t-production plants are to be found here. The most prominent of these are the Doit tier and. the Heinkel aiix:raft-components factories, the Argus aero-engine factory, Maschinenfabrik Prometheus G.n.b. H., and the Deutsche Waffen- und Munitions- Fabriken A.G,
To the North there are many snail and scattered factories, the chief of which are at Lichteriberg, where Siemens Planiawerke and a number of other engineering works are located. To the South, at Mariendorf, Tempelhof and Britz, the chief factories lie on the South side of the Tempelhof airfield. Industries are also to be found on the Eastern outskirts of Neukölln.
The suburban areas, most of which lie far outside Berlin, have been developed mainly during the last twenty years. As a rule they are largely residential, but in sane cases industrial development has taken place. The greatest extensions have been made along the railways to the North-west towards Hennigsdorf and Oranienburg; to the North-cast to Bern&u: to the East beyond Mahlsdorf: to the South-east beyond Köpenick to Wildau; to the South to Lichtenrade: and to the South-west around the South of the liavel See to Potsdam.

General
The city is supplied from external sources chiefly by the EWAG and the MEW systems. The BKL BE..AG) controls all the main power stations in the city. The total capacity of the generating stations is 1,250 MW.
External Supply
There are two main outside systems of supply to the city. The first, the EWAG system, supplies current from Golpa-Zschornewitz and Trattendorf. These lines enter Berlin at Spandau and at Rummelsburg and thence are linked up to the BKL BEiYAG) system. Two lines come from Trattendorf; one skirts the northern suburbs and enters at Spandau, the other connects with BKL BEWAG) system at Friedrichsfelde.
The other i3 the MEW system, which encircles Berlin and introduces current from the power stations at Finkenheerd, Finow, and Hennigsdorf.
Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEiYAG)- A.G.
"Deutsche Edison" was founded in 1883 and in the following year was granted a concession to supply electrical current to part of the city of Berlin. This concession was transferred to the Städtische Elektrizitätswerke on its formation. Later, this company became the Berliner Elektrizitätswerke (BE.V), and the concession was extended to cover the whole of the city of Berlin.
In 1915 the city itself took over the direction of the firm under the name Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Berlin (STEW), but this was again altered in 1923 to Berliner Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Akt. Ges. (BEWAG).
In 1931 the Berliner Kraft- und Licht-Aktiengesellschaft (BKL) was formed to administer the electrical, installations owned directly by the city and those owned by BEiYAG. The BEWAG capital was transferred to the new company and two other Berlin companies - Elektrowerke A.G. (SWAG) and Preussische Elektrizitäts Aktiengesellschaft-also became shareholders of the new company.
Finally, in 1934, BEiYAG and BKL were completely amalgamated to form the present Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG) - A.G.
In 1938, BKL BEiYAG) - the new company - acquired the firm of Elektrizitätswerk Sädwest A.G. (ESA) and so widened it3 territorial interests to Schflneberg, Wilmersdorf and
Public Utilities (Electricity)
Schmargendorf. In the same year, as a result of an agreement made in 1928. it acquired from Märkisches Elektrizitätswerk A.G. (MEW) territorial interests in Dahlem, Lankwitz, Lichtenrade, Mariendorf, Südende, and Tempelhof. Thus 3KL (3EWAG) acquired the interests in the whole of the city as far as the small outlying districts of Wannsee and Buch. The company claims that this is the largest system of electrical manufacture and distribution in any one city in the world.
BKL BEWAG power stationKlingenberg(1+)
This is the largest of the thermal power stations owned by the Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG) -A.G. , which supply electricity to the Berlin area. Built in 1926/28, it operates on base load and has an installed capacity of 270 MY. but is designed for an ultimate capacity of 540 MV. It i3 situated on the North bank of the river Spree in the South-east of the city on a site of 50 acres; the main control room for the BKL BEWAG) system is in the nine-storied office block which also houses large water tanks on its top floor.
Prom a 50 kV switch house at least 48 three-phase 30 kV underground cables are operated in pairs and are connected to different substations in the Berlin area. There is also a 30 kV connection to the adjacent 81 MV. Rummelsburg station.
BKL BEWA& power stationBerlin-West(1+)
This station is the second largest of the BKL BEWAG) system and has an installed capacity of 228 MV. Built in 1929/1932, it i3 situated on the North bank of the river Spree in the western area of the city near the Siemens works at Siemenstadt. It was originally operated mainly to supply part of the Berlin day load, the night load being supplied by the Klingenberg station and by long-distance transmission from the large brown-coal-fired stations at Golpa-Zschomewitz, Trattendorf, Lauta, Pinkenheerd, and elsewhere. The small Unterspree power station is situated 300 yards to the South-west, on the bank of the Spree. The main supply at 30 kV from the station is through underground cables to the Berlin city network via the 30 kV switch house. Supplies are also given direct to the nearby Siemens works. In addition to auxiliary supplies 3ome small local supplies are probably given at 6.3 kV via the 6.3 kV switch house.
BKL BEWAG power station .Charlottenburg(1)
This thermal power station, owned by BKL BEWAG), has an installed capacity of 109 MW. Built in 1900, it was completely reconstructed in 1925 in two sections, of which one, with a capacity of 59 MW. , operates on base load, while the other plant, which has a capacity of 50 MW. , meets the peak load. It is situated in the western area of the city, on the North bank of the
BKL HEY/AG) power stationCharlottenburg
(contd.)
river Spree. There is a 30 kV substation containing twelve G/30 kV transformers of a total capacity of 116 MW. and ore 30/3 kV inter-bus transformer of 8 M11. capacity. Local supplies are connected by underground cables to Spandau,
Knie, the Sianens works, Moabit, and to the nearby 100 kV. substation. The 100 kV substation connected the Berlin 30 kV underground cable systan with the 100 kV transmission system. One 100 kV line goes to Spandau, 6 miles to the Northwest, and one to Moabit, from there continuing to Friedrichsfelde substation (9 miles East of Charlottenburg). The electrical output is supplied to Berlin. Steam is also supplied at 281 lbs/sq.in. for a district-heating system.
BKL BEWAG power stationRunaelsburg
This station is situated in Surmelsburg, a suburb in the South-east of Berlin, on the North bank of the river Spree within £ mile of the Klingenberg station and has an installed capacity of 81 MW.
A 100/30 kVA substation close to the generating plant transforms 100 kV supplies from the EWAG grid to 50 kV for local distribution. One 100 kV double-circuit line goes to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 4 miles to the North, and one to Golpa-Zschornewitz.The substation serves for
local distribution at 30 kV rather than for supplying electricity externally.
A 6/30 kV substation connects the 100/30 kV substation to the generating station, and contains at least two 6/30 kV transformers each of 18 MW, capacity; it connects the generating station to the 30 kV grid of the Berlin area and with the 100/30 kV substation it also serves for local distribution at 6 kV.
BKL BEY/AG power stationKoabit
This is one of the oldest stations of the BKL 3EWAG) system supplying the Berlin area and has an installed capacity of 81 MW. It is operated for peak load and standby purposes. It is situated in the North-west central district on the Schiffahrt3-Kanal and consists of 2 parts; these are composed of a large number of reconditioned old units or replacements, which made identification of plant difficult.
A substation for 100/30 kV steps down the supplies received through the 100 kV grid for distribution over the Berlin 30 kV grid. The substation is partly open air and partly in the old engine house; it contains at least 5 transformers each of 16 MW.
Long distance 100 kV lines pass to Spandau, 7 miles distant, and to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 8 miles East of Moabit. A 6/30 kV substation gives supplies to the Berlin 30 kV grid. Local distribution is also at 6 kV.
BKL BEWAG power station'Wilmersdorf
This station on the BKL BEWAG system is situated at Wilmersdorf, a South-western suburb of Berlin close to the Rudolsthdterstrasse, and has an installed capacity of 62 MW. This station was built by ESA in about 1905 and supplies the South-western area of Berlin. It is believed that the Wilmersdorf station is now used by BIX (SEWAG) for standby purposes only. An A. C./D. C. converter plant is attached to the station. The city of Berlin is supplied at 6.6. kV and at lower voltages, and supplies are also given to the underground railways.
It is possible that this station has been connected by BKL BSWAG) to the 50 kV Berlin grid and that a 30/g kV substation has been added to serve as a local distribution centre.
BKL BEWAG) power stationSpandau
This station on the BKL 3EWAG) system is situated on the Havel See near Spandau, a North-west suburb of Berlin and has an installed capacity of 56 MW.
The generating plant is used for standby and peak load only.
One double ciruit line goes to Trattendorf, one to Brandenburg (there connecting to Golpa-Zschomewitz and Diesdorf), and one to Charlobtenburg. There is a 100 kV connection to Henningsdorf (5 miles to the North).
Local supplies are given at 6 kV, and to the Berlin grid at 30 kV.
This station contains one of the main substations in Berlin. It has at least two 100/30 kV transformers, each of 16 !.IW. capacity and transforms the supplies received from Wie 100 kV grid to 30 kV for local distribution.
It is the terminus of the 220 kV line which was partially constructed before the war and is now probably completed; starting at Bra uw eil er, the line reaches Spandau via Koepehenwerk, Bielefeld, Lehrte, Harbke, Diesdorf (Magdeburg), and Brandenburg; a distance of 385 miles by this route.
E'.VAG switch stationFriedrichsfelde
This important switch station is owned by E'WAG and is situated on the east side, of the city. Two 100 kV lines from Golpa-Zschomewitz and Trattendorf power stations pass to Berlin. It is also connected to the Moabit and Rummelsburg transforming stations. The elimination of this station would seriously affect the city's external supplies and it i3, therefore, an important target.

BRAUNSCHTEIG (Brunswick)
Braunschweig, or Brunswick, on the river Oker, is the chief town of the State of the same name. It is situated on the fertile plain North of the Hartz Mountains and lies in the rich agricultural district of the Aller basin. The town is the principal marketing centre for the com, sugar, vegetables and cattle of the area. The inner town is a well preserved survival of mediaeval days with many half-timbered houses.
In early years Brunswick was a road Junction on the trade route from Hamburg to Southern Germany and the town still retains its importance as a conmunications centre. It is on the railway midway between Magdeburg and Hannover with through connections to the Baltio and North Sea coast. Brunswick is linked by its harbour with the Mittelland Canal and thus has direct access to Germany's extensive inland waterways system.
Formerly Brunswick's chief speciality was the preservation of foodstuffs and it is still an important supplier of the aimed forces'

The town has, however, now become of outstanding importance owing to the development of the aircraft and engineering industries. There are two large aircraft works in the town and two equally important works in the outlying districts of Querun and Waggum which lie within the administrative area. The industrial plants in Brunswick are mainly grouped in the southern quarter of the town in the neighbourhood of the railway yards and in the northern outskirts where there are several factories chiefly engaged in engineering.

The principal docks are in the Holm, the island formed by the Kaiserhafen and the bend of the Vistula.
The town itself is divided by the stream of the Hottlau, a tributary of the Vistula. The north-west quarter constitutes the old city, with the main railway station on its western border. Two branches of the railway run from the main station west of the river Vistula to Neufahrwasser. A separate branch leaves the main line south of Danzig, encircles the city to the east, and serves tne ports or. the Kaiserhafen and the Holm Island as well as the railway rerair shops on the right bank of the river.
There are a number of large flour mills and various industries in the central city area and in the f'iederstadt (the south-east quarter of the town) , but it is a3 a ship and submarine building centre and as a naval and submarine base and arsenal that Danzig occupies a position of

Dortmund with 550,000 inhabitants is the largest and most easterly town in the Ruhr. It is one of the chief centres of heavy industry in Germany and besides the large steel works is full of smaller concerns engaged in engineering of all kinds. The town's geographical position at the eastern extremity of the Ruhr, at the terminus of the Dortmund-Sms Canal, and in the centre of the Westphalian coal fields make it one of the busiest commercial centres in Germany•
Although most of the marshalling yards in the Dortmund district are relatively small it is, next to Duisburg, the principal transport centre of the Ruhr particularly for through traffic to Central, North and Eastern Germany. The harbour situated at the terminus of the Dortnund-Ems Canal is of particular, importance.
Dort-.und proper has only one power station which though large is of local importance only. Though there are several electric power plants in the vicinity of the city they are all privately owned concerns of comparatively s.mall capacity and concerned only with the pits or works to which they belong. Gas is obtained fron the Ruhr Gas Grid. There is an important V.E.W. station at Lttnen with a capacity of 135 MW.
There are two important industrial area in Dortmund. The first lies on the western side of the t own and contains the very important harbour and two marshalling yards and south of the harbour, the large steel works of the Dortmund Httrder Httttenverein A.G.
The second area lies to the north east of the city and consists of the huge Hoesch steelworks, the Hoesch-Bcnsin G.m.b.H. Fischer-Trqpsch plant and a marshalling yard which envelopes the north western side of the steelworks; also within this area is the Minister Stein concern with coke ovens, a by-products plant, and the power plant.
Scattered throughout the town are numerous plants of secondary importance, the majority of which are engaged on engineering.
At HCrde, to the south-east of Dortmund lies the Dortmund Httrder Httttenverein, a subsidiary of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and in its western portion the coking plant. In the north there are two important concerns; at Kamen a Fischer Tropsch plant, and west of Lttnen on the Seiten Canal the Lippewerk of the Vereinigte Aluminium Werke A.G.
Outside Dortmund there are numerous coke oven plants including "Hansa", the second largest in Germany, and several colliery concerns.
To the extreme North West of the area is the shy-lift and the shaft-lock at the junction of the Dortmund-Eins and Rhein-Heme canals.

DUISBURG (Rhineland)
51° 25' N. 6° 45' E: 300 miles: (437,600)
The area covered Ilea in the Western extremity of the industrial distriot of the Ruhr.
It is traversed from South to North by the Rhine, on the 'Test of which is flat lightly-wooded oountry with scattered villages and small towns, lying at the general level of 75 to loo feet above sea level. On the East of the Rhine the country is much more thickly populated and rises eastwards to about 200 feet, except in the gap through which run the River Ruhr and the Rhine-Herne oanal. To the North and South are extensive forests.
Duisburg is by far the largest town in this distriot with a population of nearly 440,000 (including Hamborn). It lies on both sides of the mouth of the river Ruhr and includes the townships of Ruhrort, Hamborn, Wanheimerort, Hückingen, Rheinhausen, Wedau, Grossenbaum and Dinslaken.
Duisburg owes its industrial inportanoe and prosperity to the presence, in its immediate vicinity, of hard coal in very considerable quantities. This has accounted for the development of iron and steel, heavy engineering, and other industries and brought about the necessity for construction and repeated expansion of the Duisburg-Ruhrort Harbour situated at the mouth of the river Ruhr.
Duisburg's situation at the confluences of the rivers Rhine and Ruhr and in the centre of the western concentration of the Ruhr industrial area gives it great importance from the point of view of transportation. Its main olaim to fame is that it is here more than anywhere else in the Ruhr or Rhineland that the transfer of goods from rail to water or water to rail takes place, and it is this factor that has made Duisburg the greatest inland waterway harbour in Europe.
The railway network at Duisburg has been constructed primarily to provide ample facilities to deal with the rail traffic originating from, or destined for the waterways} this function is fulfilled by the extensive marshalling yards at Ruhrort Helfen Neu Sohultenhof, which handled about 14 million tons of traffic annually before the w 'r. a second - and scarcely less important - funotion of the system is to aoocomodate the North-South and the West-East flow of land traffic; this is achieved by the marshalling yards at Duisburg main station, and, amongst others, these at Oberhausen Vest in the North-East (see under 'Oberhausen"), at Wedau to the South-East, and at Hohenbudberg on the left bank of the river Rhine (see under "Uerdingen").
In addition, Duisburg lies on the Rhine-Herne Canal, which leaves the Rhina at this point and Joins the Dortmund-Sms Canal near Datteln and thus links Duisburg by waterway with the North Sea at fänden and the Mittelland Canal at Bevergern. There are two harbours to deal with the waterborne traffic, which oonsists in the main of coal, ooke, and finished iron aikl steel goods (outwards): iron-ore, grain and timber (inwards); the harbours are also important for storage reasons.
There are no particularly important electrical power plants in this ares. The Town Power Station has a oapaoity not exceeding 50 Mf and is oonneoted to the main R.W.E. grid system through Brauweiler.
The principal industries are mining, the conversion of coal into ooke, gas and the usual by-products, iron and steel maisifaoture, and heavy engineering The ooal and iron and steel industry is almost entirely in the hands of Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and its subsidiary panies, the Gelsenkirohener Bergwerke A.G. which (erstes some of the largest pits and ooke ovens, the August Thyssen Bitte A.G' which operates four great blast furnace plants, the Deutsche Eisenwerk A.G. which is responsible for blast furnaces at Hambom, the Deutsche ffthrenwerk A.G. and Bandeisenwalswerke A.G. (which controls the rolling mills at Dinslaken) and the Eisenwerk Wanheim G. nub. H.
These numerous and highly i^>ortant industrial plants are spread over an extensive area stretching from the South West mainly along the East bank of the Rhine to Dinslaken in the North and extending East to the boundaries with Oberhausen and Mulheim.
Transportation
Inland PortDuisburg-Ruhrort (1)
The inland port is the largest in Europe and covers an area of 632 hectares. The harbour forms the intermediary between railways and waterways, its primary activity being the dispatch of a large portion of the output of the Westphalian ooal fields. There ere numerous ore depots, and the harbour also handles grain. By its position Duisburg-Ruhrort has beoome a natural Junction for the Lower Rhine and Westphalian railways.
The port lies at the mouth of the River Ruhr, which is navigable for large oraft to approximately 1 mile above Mülheim, and by smaller barges as far aa Witten. The Duisburg-Ruhrort harbour is also the terminus of the Rhine-Heme canal. The volume of goods handled in 1938 amounted to approximately 14,700,000 tons (inwards) and 16,500,000 tons (outwards).

DÜNEBERG-KRÜMMEL (Schleswig-Holstein)
53° 27' N. 10° 22' E: 468 miles: (8,500)
The villages of Dune berg and Krumnel lie to the North West and South East respectively of the small town Geesthaoht (population 8,500). Both villages are of industrial importance on account of the two large works of the Dynamit A'-G. which are situated there.
Dynamit A.-G.Duneberg(1)
This factory is operated by Dynamit A. G. , and is quite near the Krümmel factory, with which it is associated. In the last war the Düneberg factory was Germany's largest producer of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Host of this production was sent to the Knimnel factory for the manufacture of powder. There has been very little ground information on the activities of this plant during the present war, and there is no air cover. Such reports as have been received suggest that it has attained at least its former aotivity, and it is probable that it bears the same relation to the KTÜnnel plaint as formerly.
On this basis it may be assumed that the nitrocellulose production is upwards of 38,000 tons per annum, but it would be difficult to guess the nitroglycerine or diglyooldiniträte production, since it is unlikely that Germany will have oonoentrated her production of this class of explosive to so great a degree as in the last war, and at least one new factory engaged in this production has been identified.
/Dynamit A.G.
Dynamit A.-G.Krümmel (1)
Thi' factory is operated by Dynamit A.G, and during the lest wer wes the lsrgest propellent powder feotory in Germany, accounting for nearly one-third of the total German output of oordite, and also accounting for about 10 per cent, of the total German production of Nitrocellulose.
In the peace years this factory was allowed to oontinue operations, manufacturing small quantities of nitroglycerine (probably for mining explosives); it also introduced, strangely enough, the production of T. N.T, on a small scale (a little over 1,000 tons a year), and engaged in the production of nitrocellulose for oelluloid and synthetic fibre production.
There is very little information regarding the activities of the KrOsmel factory in the present war, but it is clear that a very large labour force is now employed. Apart, however, from a report that its nitroglycerine or diglycol dinitrate production approaches 5000 tons per annum, which is roughly the same as the production in the last war, there is little information as to its output. On the basis of the nitroglycerine or diglycoldinitrate output, it seems likely that this factory has achieved at least its last war importance, and may have considerably exceeded it. This would indicate a nitrocellulose output of about
20,000tons a year. The factory lies on the banks of the Kibe, east of the village of Geesthacht. There is also probably a largs propellant powder plant on this site.

Reishols, Benrath, Nievenheim (including Stüraelberg) Heerdt (including Niederkassel and Oberkassel) and Lohausen (including Stockum). The city of Neuss on the western bank of the Rhine is to be found under its own heading and is not included in Düsseldorf. The total population for this area is 559,000 (1940).
The city of Düsseldorf has a population of 528,000 (1940) and is the leading ooanekoial oity of western Germany. Situated on the eastern bank of the Rhine, it has exceptionally good transport facilities both by river and rail. It is furthermore< Germany's third largest inland port, and therefore of particular importance as a transport centre. During and after the last war, Düsseldorf developed considerably and so far as the production of armaments and general engineering is oonsemed, it is as important as Essen or Duisburg. In addition Düsseldorf is the seat of the General Administrative Departments of practically all the important iron and steel, heavy engineering, and armament concerns in Rhine and Ruhr districts.
The distribution of industry ih the Düsseldorf area may be said to lie in 4 main areass-
i)The eastern and southern part of the oity proper. This is a highly concentrated area containing large engineering works, machine tool makers, wire-drawing plant, and the municipal gas and eleotrioity works.
ii)The northern suburb of Derendorf and townships of Rath and Ratingen. Here are to be found extensive marshalling yards and highly important armament manufacturers.
iii)The harbour area on the Rhine to the southwest of the oity with docks, storage and engineering firms.
South of Düsseldorf at Reishols and Benrath. Engineering and chemical works, oil refinery and storage, eleotrioity works, electric resistance wire works, lead and zino fabrioators are all grouped in this area whioh extends in a south-westerly and north-easterly direction and embraces the townships of Nievenheim and Erkrath.

These Important marshalling yards lie to the Northeast of the oity approx, one mile north to the main passenger station. These yards have a capacity of 2,100 wagons per 24 hours.

The Düsseldorf City Power Station consists of two generating stations sometimes known as Flingern I •nd Flingern II stations. They are situated on the same site snd separated only by the oamon coal storage ground, ,nd by a group of 6 cooling towers.
Of the 9 Turbo generator sets installed before 1938 it is known that 4 are in station I and 5 in Station IX The two most recently installed sets ay have replaced two older sets of smaller capacity.
It is believed that a convertor or rectifier station is attached to station I to supply D.C. to the central part of Düsseldorf.
There ie a common 5/25 kV A.C. substation for both stations.
A.C. supplies are given at 5 W and 25 kV. D.C. supplies are given at 600 volts - probably for traction - and at low voltages, for the D.C. network of the central part of the city.
It is believed that the station is connected by 25 W cables to the Lierenfeld 110 kV substation in the South, and to the Rath 110 kV substation in the North of Düsseldorf. Both of these substations are connected to the 110 kV grid of the F.W.E. company.

An oil refinery owned by the I&enania Oasag-ccnpany adjoins the station and a small chemical plant, possibly for hydrogen production, is situated among the station buildings. These two plants are probably largo consumers of the eleotrical output of the station.
In 1938 the existing turbo-generator sets had a total oapaoity of 75 MW. It is believed that there were two or three units with a total oapaoity of 15 MW and three or four units with a oapaoity of 15-20 MW each. In 1939 two additional sets eaoh of 20 MW oapaoity were installed by the A.E.G.
The machine house is at present being further extended and it is possible that more generating plant is being installed. (Total installed caapoity 115 MW.)
There is an indoor substation for local supplies which are probably given through medium and lew voltage underground oables. Local supplies are given to the adjacent works mentioned above, and to the industrial area of Düsseldorf.
There is a 110 kST outdoor substation in which at least 2 transformers are installed. Two 110 k7 lines leave the station. 0ns goes to the Erftwerk (Grevenbroioh) aluminium plant of the VAWAG- nd crosses the Rhine ismediately on leaving the station.

The smelters and refineries at Hettstedt treat the blister copper from Eisleben, copper ores and mattes from Mansfeld, Liedersdorf, and Hasel as well as copper scrap.
The Mansfeld plants at Eisleben and Hettstedt fabricate virtually the whole production of the Mfcnafeld refineries. They have an output of approximately 25,000 tons per annum of copper sheet and wire, the bulk being in the form of copper sheet.
Elbing is an important Baltic port where the Schichau ship-building concern have extensive yards. It is on the main railway lines from Berlin and Stettin to Königsberg, Riga and the Eastern front. The town has an important engineering ana shipbuilding industry and has gained considerably in industrial importance since 1939 owing to its large submarine building yards.

Emden, situated on the right bank of the Ems estuary opposite the Dutch coast, is the most westerly of the German North Sea portB and the nearest to England. The surrounding country is flat, and low-lying, intersected by canals and almost entirely devoted to agriculture. Apart from its harbour and associated industly, Emden and the sunrounding district is not industrially significant. Its position, however, as a terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and the Ema-Jade Canal connecting Emden with Wilhelmshaven makes it  valuable service port for the Ruhr, particularly in the handling of Swedish iron ore for which it is specially equipped. It is also important as a naval station, a base for mine-layers and mine-sweepers, and for its facilities for shipbuilding and ship repairs.
There are four main harbours, the Outer Harbour, the inner Harbour, the New Inner Harbour, and the Industry Harbour, Of these, only the Outer Harbour is tidal, the others being entered from the sea, either via the lock at the entrance to the New Inner Harbour, or through that at the northern end of the Outer Harbour. The Outer Harbour is capable of accommodating the largest sea-going vessels at its quays.

The New Inner Harbour, in which is handled s large proportion of Emden's traffic, is reached by the large ooean look (260 m. long by 40 m, wide). On the south of this harbour ia the Ore and Iron Quay; ooal and coke are also dealt with at this quay.
Adjacent to the New Inner Harbour on the north is the Industry Harbour with the Nordseewerke shipyard and a briquette factory.
The harbour equipment includes a great variety of cranes, and good railway connections to the quays enable loading to be effected direct from truck to ship without the need of intermediate storage.
Emden Is supplied with electricity on the grid system. A grid 'nd transformer station is situated at the eastern extremity of the Industry Harbour. A small power plant on the east quay of the Inner Harbour, at its southern end, supplies power for dock installations.
Emden has no important local industries. Its value lies rather in its trade, which causes £he port to rank high among German seaports. It is the import and export harbour for bulk goods to and from the eastern and oentral Ruhr, notably serving this district with suppliesof iron ore from Sweden. There is also an aotive trade in agricultural produce, cattle, timber, coal and coke, while it was in peace time an important base for the deep sea fishing fleet. On the east quay of the Outer Harbour are large grain warehouses and silo. Submarines and small surface craft are constructed at the Nordseewerke.

The area covered by this report is in the central part of the Ruhr; it consists of undulating country varying fron 100 to 400 ft. above sea level with some wooded area to the north and south. Essen includes within its boundaries a number of sprawling suburbs with a total population of 670,000; the original town and surrounding villages hare long since outgrown their boundaries and industrialisation has given the area a character not unlike that of an English mining district.
SsBen is the great armaments centre of the Ruhr. Its reputation as Germany's greatest armaments arsenal ("Die Waffenschmiede des Reichs" as the Germans call it) originates from World War I in the course of which the famous Friedrich Krupp works expanded on a scale unprecedented in hiatqry•
In 1917/18 a peak figure of over 150,000 workers were employed by the Fr. Krupp i.G. undertaking, some 80,000 of whom worked at the main plant at Essen.

At the southern boundary of the d is trio t is the Elver Ruhr, which is navigable by aller barges fron Duisburg to Witten,east of Essen. Across tbs oentre of the ares run the &asoher Canal and the Rhine-Heme Canal. The fomar is used for drainage purposes and runa from Walsvat on the Rhine to Dortmund. The latter ia an important connecting link between the Rhine and the Dor tmund-Ema D“nal; along it passes traffic whioh baa ocoe down the Rhine and ita tributaries to Duisburg-Ruhr art and by its junction with the Dortmund-Ems Canal the traffic peases on to the Mittelland Canal and ao to the great towns of north Germany. Damage to any of tha three looks would therefore have a serious effeot on the industrial life of a great pert of the oountry. It will he observed that many of tha Important industries of this district lie oloae to ocr on the oenal harbours.

A1though it is hardly possible to distinguish any areas as industrially more important than others, ‘because any attempt to do so would leave out of acoount some very important targets, it may be said that the principal group of targets covered by this report lie within the area of Essen proper, and stretch north-westwards from Issen-town to the Rhine-Heme Canal.
It includes the steel woritB of Friedrich Krupp A.G. as well asfc
the vast arms, locomotives and general engineering works of that
firm, besides large coal mines and coke-oven plants; the zinc

important chemicals and non-ferrous metals works Th.Goldschmidt
A.G. (now inactive, see under Non-Ferrous Metals); and finally
the important railway traffic centre Essen-Verschiebebahnhof.
During 1943, the town of Essen wan largely devastated.
Extremely, severe damage was inflicted on the Friedrich Krupp works and it was thought that by the end of July 1943, output had been reduced to one third of capaoity. Since then, some reconstruction has taken place, and by the end of 1943 output was reckoned at l&jL of pre-raid capacity.
The works of Theodore Goldschmidt A.G. were also severely damaged and are believed to be inactive (see under Non-ferrous Metals).

The finished and semi-finished product' of these tremendous works cover an extensive range, only the more important of which can be mentioned here.
The northern part of the works contains one of the largest locanotive shops in Europe, which consists of a simple building having 19 parallel bays, with a total floor space of over 88,000 square yards.
There is a tyre-rolling plant covering 34.000 square yards, which has an annual production estimated at 315.000 tyres and
120,000wheel centres.
The numerous forges are capable of producing the largest forgings for guns, including the heavier naval types, parts for turbines and locomotives, and also smaller forgings such as components for motor vehicles and aircraft. The hammer and forging shops contain 120 steam hanmers and 11 steam hydraulic presses. In the largest forging shop there are presses of 200, 4-00, and 500 tons capacity, and one large press of 1,500 tons capacity, which is served by two 400-ton cranes manipulating the ingots, while another two 100-ton cranes handle the necessary toolB. '
Amongst the many rolling mills are those containing drawing and flanging presses of various capacity, aggregating over 8,000 tons.
There are several foundries for iron, malleable iron, rustless end heat-resisting castings and non-ferrous castings in brass, bronzes, and aluminium.
Besides these, there are numerous other shops engaged on general engineering.
The number of employees engaged in the heavy engineering and armaments section of the works was estimated at 75,000 in 1942.

The nearby town of Off enhn nh/kain, lying within the borders at the province Hesse, is dealt with separately under Offenbach,
Frankfurt is the oomeroial, industrial and cultural metropolis of the Upper Rhineland, an important transport centre, and since 1933 also important as a military training centre with a large mnbar of new and extensive barracks situated around the Friedberger Warte in the suburb Praunheim to the North of the town.
CcniTri nations
Frankfort is an iaqportanl railway junction on the lines from Berlin to Basle, from Cologne via Nürnberg to Vienna, from Hamburg and Kassel and from Dresden and Leipzig to Frame and Switzerland, The river Main is sufficiently dredged to take heavy barge traffic several hundred miles up the river, thus eking Frankfort one of the leading inland {torts on the Rbeiiw Main^Oanube canal route.
Industry
The largest industrial plants in the area are the ohawrl oal works of I.O. Farbenindustrie at HBchst and Grleshein-on-Main some 5 miles west of the town. Within the built-up outskirts at Frankfort proper are the Adler Werke, important manufacturers of motor vehicles military transport, and imnedlately adjacent the large works of Alfred Teves which in pre-war days produced the well known ATE refrigerators and were also the leading maaxf&ofeirers in Germany of Loakhead brakes nfl piston rings. The Teves works have been enlarged considerably durirg the last four years and have replaced refrigerator production by the amwfaoture of retractable undercarriages for aircraft and a variety of other aircraft oaqpoaenta.
At Heddernheim, a North-3aatem suburb, la the i^>ortajrt non-ferrous metal works of the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke formerly well known under the neme of Heddernheiaar Kupferwerke, To the war industry this plant is of particular importance as a prominent producer at air-screws.
 
Many other factories, the production of which is solely confined to the supply of Germany's war machine, are located within this town. Among these special war products are aircraft and motor-vehicle instruments, detonating apparatus for naval mines, precision measuring instruments, special electrical gear, including range finding apparatus for the Navy, small-arms-ammunition and so forth. Frankfort has also large grain stores, flour mills, power stations, and oil storage plants.
In addition to the huge ohesiioal plants at Griesheim and HBchst, more than twenty other chemical factories are located, within, or in the lamed i a to vicinity of the town. Frankfort is often referred to as the centre of Germany's chemical industry. This ia partly due to the fact that the I. G. , Germany's great ohemical trust, have their administrative headquarters here in the so-called I.G. Hochhaus. This is a very modern office building in the western section of the town where more than
3,000officials, are housed. In addition Frankfort is also the headquarters of the "Degussa" Chemical concern (Deutsche Gold A Silber 3oheideanstalt) another important chemical trust and of the Metallgesellsohaft A. G. , a large chemioal and non-ferrous metal concern.
Principal Industrial Areas
Mithin or immediately adjacent to the built-up area of the town are a number of industrial targets of primary importance situated in two distinctly separate areas
Area "A" - Stretching South from the Main Goods Yards to the River Main includes such important targets as the Adler Merke A.G. (vorm. Hch. Kleyer), building M.

In addition to its production of copper and oopper-alloy Semiproducts Heddernheim is believed to be producing a large range of semi-products in light alleys for use by aircraft manufacturers and other armament manufacturers and an important range of specialized aircraft components. The semiproducts include sheet and strip, tubes, pressings and stampings, extruded sections, and castings. The special aircraft components are known to include airscrew hubs and all metal variable pitch airaorews, retractable undercarriages and oleo legs, wheels, shock-absorber devices and control gear. Examples of V.D.M. products in military equipment are also known, and the company ia almost oertainly also making light-metal fittings for submarines.
Capacity
An up-to-date estimate for the oapaoity of the Heddernheim works is difficult to produce, especially owing to the difficulty of estimating the extent to whioh copper^fabricating plant in this and other works has been turned over to working on light alloys.
It is known that Heddernheim had one of
the best rolling mills in Germany for
aluminium sheet and strip and produced
about 6,000 tons per year which was
about 10^ of tha country's total former output.
Heddernheim's capacity for the production of extruded sections is believed to have been about if, 000 tons per year or about 25/S of the total German oapaoity. At least 50$$ of the total output was required-by the aircraft industry. It is also (after I.G Bitterfeld) one of tire two most important producers of wrought magnesium -elloy products.
The output of ooiqplete airsorews at Heddernheim at the present time is believed to be slightly above 30$o of the total German production.

Allmansweiler )
The Allmansweiler-IjBwenthal plant has been devoted to final assembly, special installations, tests, and possibly repairs of Do. 217.
In August 1943, according to a well-informed source, this unit was the centre for the development of specialised Dornier types such as the Do. 217M, equipped with DB. 603 engines, and a high altitude reconnaissance type. At that time it was assembling 20 Do. 217s per month. Sinoe then all
/ evidenca

FRIEDRICHSHAFEN (continued)
evidence points to decreased activity mi reoent cover of the field shows only 20 to 25 aircraft, including a number of modified types and experimental models. It is doubtful if new Do. 217s are being produced here at present, though repairs and the installation of special equipment may be continuing on a small scale.
Interest in this plant as a target derives mainly from (1) reports that the Dornier organization and this unit in particular are tooling up for produotion of F.W. 190s, (2) reports that oertain Dornier plants in the Friedriohshafen area are engaged in produotion of the Peenemflnde 20, and (3) the possibility that this plant may resume produotion of Do.217 fighters in an effort to make up losses in twin-engine fighters resulting from reoent attacks on German aircraft factories and operating attrition of the GAF.
Dornier Werke G.m.b. H.Manzell
(2)
This plant is the parent works of the Dornier oonplex at Friedriohshafen. A year ago it was engaged in experimentation and development of new Dornier types, the produotion of Do 217 components for assembly at Allmansweiler/lyBwenthal, and possibly some seaplane development and assembly.
The nature and scale of the plant's activities at present oan only be inferred-from the accumulation of existing ground reports. This intelligence ia sunmarized below:
i)There is no evidenoe that seaplanes are being assembled, though the plant probably serves as a seaplane base and may continue to do experimental work on Dornier seaplanes.
ii)Manufacture of Do 217 components may be continuing on a reduoed scale.
The total output of Do 217s in all three ooa^lexes is not believed at present to exceed 20 per month.
/ (iü)
iii)With other plants in the
Friedriohshafen district, Corner at Manzell may contribute in some way to the production of pilotless aircraft. Intelligence . is not conclusive on this point but points strongly to some type of involvement.
iv)This plant may be tooling up for
the manufacture of FW 190 components since it is reported that Dornier is to undertake produotion of this aircraft and Friedrichshafen nas been specifically mentioned.
Engineering and Armaments
Maybach Motorenbau G.m-b.H.Friedriohshafen (1)
While the Maybach plant has been variously reported producing ball bearings, aeroengines, gears, gear boxes, and a multiplicity of other articles, its primary importance lies in the tank-engine field. Virtually all German tank engines are Maybach designed and available evidence renders it probable that upward of 60 per cent, of all German tank engines pass through the Friedrichshafen works. Tha plant also produces about one third of Germany's engines for semi-tracked vehioles.
Engine repair facilities of considerable size and importance are also contained within the Friedrichshafen plant.
Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen A.G.Friedriohshafen (1)
Ground reports and other sources of intelligence Justify classifying the Zahnradfabrik Friedriohshafen as Germany's leading gear and gear-box makers. The relative importance of the firm's several plants is difficult to assess but it may be safely said that the Friedriohshafen branch is one of the leading German gear makers, making its greatest contribution to the A. F. V. field, but being important also in the manufacture of aircraft reduction gear, truck steering gears, eto.

Fürstenhagen lies a few miles south of Kassel in s wooded area and prior to the war it was of no industrial importance at all.
Sinoe 1939 a very large unidentified works has been erected here and the large number of workers employed on its construction and on production within the completed parts of the works, are housed in groups of hutments in the Fflrstenhagen area, thus increasing its population to probably more than 5,000.
Chemicals and Explosives
Unidentified factory possibly making explosives (2)

No ground information about this plant has been obtained. Its existence was detected by photograph reconnaissance.
The factory is very large, and its layout is not typical of any known explosives plant. The size, construction and mounding of the buildings suggests very strongly that it is associated with the manufacture of a sensitive high explosive, and there is certainly nothing which can be associated with the manufacture of a solid propellant explosive or with the manufacture of propellant powder.

The chief producer of lead in the district is the Rammelsberg mine, situated 2 miles south of Goslar, which, when working at full pressure, yields an output of lead concentrates amounting to about 30^ of Germany's total production; the copper output of this mine, though principally a producer of lead end zinc, is also considerable. The minirg company owning the mine, the Unterharzer Berg- u. Hüttenwerke, is a subsidiary of the Preussische Bergwerks- u. Hüllen A.G. which company operates other metal mines in Klausthal and Lautenthal through subsidiary undertakings .
The mines are scatterdamong the hills, at Harlingerode to the East, Rammelsberg to the South, and at Klausthal and Lautenthal to the south west. The latter two areas are referred to under their own names.
There are a number of small industries such as textile fancy goods, a chemical factory which is mentioned below, and a factory making office requisites which is some note in that branch. At Langelsheim 5 mile3 to the west is a factory making chemical products.

The activity of the Gotha plant has expanded more or less steadily since 1934 when some 3,000 workers were employed. By 1937 that number had increased to 4,000 and by 1939 some 4,500 were employed. Further expansion has occured in the course of this war.
Prior to the war a large proportion of this
this plant was devoted to the manufacture of narrow gauge locomotives, trailers and other heavy vehicles. During the early part of this war these activities were continued on a smaller scale end some of the capacity of the

plant that became available is believed to have been employed on the
manufacture of tank transport vehicles. There is reason to believe that most of
these activities were dragged in the course of the last two to three years and that the plant was practically completely converted for the manufacture of aircraft components and the assembly of aircraft particularly the erection of components and the final assembly of Me. 110.
Prior to a raid by the U.S. Air Force in February, 1 %4, in the course of which the works was very severely damaged, its estimated output was 75 Me. 110 per month.

Halle" is a railway centre of great importance. It is or. the main line from Berlin to Frankfort/t.'.ain and together with Leipzig which is 20 miles to the S.E. it forms the focal point of the railway system of industrial Saxony.
Apart from the railway workshops and the aeroplane factory described below, the industry of Halle is mostly in the hands of email firms and includes engineering works, metal famdries, printing and furniture making. To the North and °outh of the town are large brown-coal deposits ana the firms exploiting these have t eir head offices in Halle.
Halle is a compact and densely populated town. A large proportion of the population work in or in connection with the outlying districts. There are two highly important works, within 10 miles of and to the South of Halle: the Leuna works at Merseburg and the Buna works at Schkopau. At Teutschenthal 10 miles to the V/est there is a notable non-ferrous metal works. All these are dealt with under their separate headings The small suburb of Amaendorf, 1 mile to the South of Hallo, is not inside the administrative area, and is dealt with separately.

HAMBURG (including ALTONA and HARBURG-WILHELMSBURG)
53° 35' N. 10° E: 450 miles: (1,700,000)
Hamburg has, for a considerable time, held the first place among the ports of Continental Europe, and has risen to be the third largest shipping centre in the world. This development is due not only to the vast extensions and the modernisations of its Free Port, but also to the exceptional facilities offered for storing and manipulating goods.in bond - notably colonial produce and oil.
Hamburg's sea-going merchant fleet counted, on January 1st 1937, 1,538 ships, with an aggregate of 2,275,000 G.R.T.
During 1938, the port's incoming and outgoing traffic each amounted to 20^ million tons net, while imports of goods reached 18 million tons, and exports 7? million tons.
The old port was confined to the northern side of the River Elbe, but the really important and modern port has developed entirely along the river's southern bank,. This main port area falls roughly into two sections (a) centred on the HANSA-HAFEN and (b) on the ODER-HAFEN, which provide accommodation for the chief overseas liners.
In the new port too are the big shipbuilding yards, and numerous engineering and armament works.
Besides plants connected with shipbuilding, the port area accommodates other big engineering works and roughly half of Hamburg's very important oil-storage installations (total pre-war capacity over 1,300,000 tons), oil-crushing mills, non-ferrous metal works, several aircraft and aircraft component factories including important airscrew works, as,well as grain, and other foodstuff factories and storage centres.
Next in importance to the port proper comes the Harburg-Wilhelmsburg district, to the South, where big vegetable-oil plants, other foodprocessing factories, the huge grain and nroduce warehouses, chemical works and a well-known rubber-tyre factory are located.
Altona, on the northern bank of the Elbe, specialises more in light metal industries, including castings for aero-engines, but has also several other important industries and food-storage installations. In the i'nner port (Binnenhafen-Sandtorhafen), also on the Altona side of the port, lies the very congested chief warehouse area. A net of railway tracks connects this area with the Main Station of Hamburg.

One of the striking features of the central residential and commercial area of the city proper is the Alster Lake (actually a widened arm of the River gibe). The major(northern) portion of this lake is known as the Aussen-Alster (outer Alster), and the much smaller and narrower southern tip is called the Binnen-Alster (inner Alster). Crossing this portion is the Lombard bridge, which forms (or formed) the sole connecting link between the business district of the city and the large residential district to the West. The whole of the Binnen-Alster is now camouflaged.
Apart from the industries and warehouses located in the port area, Altona, and Harburg-Wilhelmsburg, there are numerous works, storage installations, etc. scattered about other districts of greater Hamburg.
The railway system includes nine major complexes of goods stations, marshalling yards, and sidings. Of these, five are situated in, or adjacent to, tfye port area. A sixth lies to the South of the Suder-Slbe (outside the port proper) stretching for about 7 km., roughly North to South, along the southern outskirts of Harburg, between the Gutmoor and the Wilstorf-Ronneburg district.
The remaining three goods yards etc. are in the Altona, Stellingen, and Barmbeck areas. All are connected with the Hamburg Central Station.
At the end of 1936 the railway-net measured 13& km.,the tramway system 232 km.

the docks area to the East of the town where the Elhe-Bille and the Moorflether canals Join the Holzhafen. Built in 1915 it has recently been extended by the addition of very high-pressure boilers and superimposed turbines. The station supplies steam to a district-heating system mainly for the surrounding area of Bille. It has an installed capacity of 129 MW.
There are no long-distance supplies but there is a substation for 25 JCV and 30 kV 3-phase A-C. and alBo for D.C. Supplies are given to the tramway system, to parts of the inner towns, to the elevated railways, and the local State railways.
There are 25 kV underground cables connecting to Bille, Barmbeck, and Carolinenstraase; and 30 kV lines connecting to Bergedorf and to Lübeck via Bargeteheide. The station is also connected to the Neuhof generating station.

Norddeutsche AffineriePeute
This is the most important oopper smelting and refining unit in Germany.
Its smelting and blast furrtaoes treat imported ores, matte, and concentrates, as well as imported scrap. The refineries treat blister oopper and imported high-grade scrap. In 1938, the plant had an estimated capacity for electrolytio refining of 90,000 tons per annum and a capacity for fire refining of 30,000 tons per annum.
Before the war, an appreciable quantity of nickel was recovered from fire-refined and electrolytio copper produced by other German refineries and, by means of the process of recovery employed at Norddeutsche Affinerie, some 3?0 tons of metallic nickel were produced annually before 1938 from these sources.
^his refinery was also engaged in recovering metal from the increased nickel coinage minted in 1933 when the coinage was recalled in l;39.
Since there is no great reservoir of nickel scrap to be drawn upon in Germany, it is probable that present production of recovered nickel amounts to only 5P[j of capacity, which is estimated at 500 tons of metal per annum. Some nickel may also be produced direct from Petsamo ores, in a small smelter which formerly treated Itoroccan nickel-cobalt ores.
These works also include a lead refining plant which had an annual capacity of 36,000 tons .before the war. Other installations are a small cobalt refinery and sulphuric acid plant. The latter is estimated to have had a capacity of 40,000 tozis per annum in 1938.

Hanover is on the trunk railway line from Berlin to the Rhinelund, Ruhr, Holland, Belgium and Northern France. It is a junction for an important branch leading from Central Germany, and has direct rail connections with Hamburg and Bremen. The Mittelland Kanal, one of the principal arteries of the North German waterways system, passes through the Northern outskirts of the town.
Hanover, which was formerly the capital of the Kingdom of Hanover, is a highly industrialised city and one of the chief commercial and administrative centres of Northern Germany, The main industries are engineering, rubber tyres, and armaments. The Continental rubber works are estimated to supply 80 per cent of Germany's aero tyre requirements, and the Hanomag factories are of outstanding importance in the manufacture of A.P.V.'s, J;un caniages, tractors, and military transport. There are a number of other large-scale industrial works, the products of which include wire and cables, A.A. and field guns, non-ferrous metal fabrication, accumulators, chemicals, and textiles. The industries are mainly grouped to the North West and West of the town. The area that extends from Brink (North of Hanover) Westwards along the Mittelland Kanal to Nordhafen and Sthcken has been selected for the development of several of Germany's now armaments plants. The Hackethal cable works, a large now accumulator factory, and now works of Continental and Hanomag, are included in this area. To the West of Hanover, in the suburbs of Leinhausen and Linden, are the parent works of Continental and Hanomag, and a number of other engineering works which are described below.

In recent years they have become highly-irnport&nt builders of tanks, ar.d heavy military vehicles.
In addition to the various heavy transport vehicles, Hanomag are also important producers of a variety of other heavy armaments products. They are reported to employ a total of at least 20,000 workers.
The parent works occupy a large area on either side of the Hamelnerstr. in the Bouth '.Yestem suburb of Linden. The Linden works have been developed into one of the major units of the German armaments industry, and they supply a large proportion of the requirements of tanks, armoured cars, gun carriages, artillery tractors and military transport of all kinds. In July 1942 this plant is said to have produced a total of 321 tanks, including 196 light and 123 medium tanks.
A second large factory has been recently completed in Brink to the North West of the city, and although reports indicate that the new works is entirely operated by the Hanomag concern the probability remains that at least parts of it are a Reichswehr ordnance depot. The/

The works of this world-famous concern are in the centre of the town and are housed in a group of buildings several storeys high including one skyscraper building of 17 storeys. Several thousand workers are employed. The great majority of the work requires a high degree of specialised skill and there is an elaborate system of training schools for apprentices. It is believed that no foreign labour is employed in Jena and because of the nature of the work, there is a probably unique concentration of highly skilled labour in this town. Zeiss have now three and possibly four large associated factories in Dresden, (Zeiss Ikon Werke A.G. ) and branch factories are known to have been established in Hirsohberg and Gorlitz in Silesia.
Zeiss controlled affiliated companies are at Stuttgart, Berlin, Rathenow and Vienna. Jena remains, however, the chief training centre for the concern and is by far the largest of the Zeiss works. It turns out the whole range of precision optical instruments required by the armed forces.
These instruments sure made in their entirety by the Zeiss works, of which one section is devoted to the casting, grinding and polishing of the lenses, while another section deals with the complete manufacture of the precision metal parts of the instruments. The apprentice schools mentioned above, train workers for each of these two sections of the industry. It is worth noting that the Zeis3 works at Jena are not an ordinary commercial concern, but since 1891 have been in the hands of a trust.
The profits belong to the workers on a copartnership basis and to the Jena University.
It is believed that the Jena Works of Zeiss alone enploy some 12,OCX), workers.

Inland HarbourKarlsruhe(2)
Karlsruhe is an important trans-shipment centre for the Rhine traffic, the chief conmioditles being coal and timber. The inland harbour, which has five basins, is entered from the Rhine through the Stichkanal which is one mile in length. The harbour area was severely damaged by the k.A.F. and lost much of its storage capa'city and other facilities. A considerable amount of repair work has been carried out and the port is now again an important trans-shipment centre.

Henschels are the leading German locomotives works and in peacetime were capable of building 200 main-line locomotives per annun in addition to a large number of smaller types. Their works were continually enlarged during the first years of the mar and with the adoption of standard locomotive types their capacity increased to many tines the above figure.
One of the most important manufacturers of trucks in Germany before the war, thi3 firm was al-so of great importance in supplying German requirements for heavy trarisport vehicles, which were largely used with trailers. Truck production was of relatively snail importance in relation to the activities of thi3 firm in other branches of engineering, although in connection with heavy road transport it was an important contribution to the German requirements. Their manufactures include municipal-type vehicles, such as road sweeping, washing and sprinkling machines, and refuse collecting vehicles; and also the "Finkbeiner" producer-gas unit which is one of the 12 types standardised by Germany.
It is belived that even before the war at least one section of the parent works (WerkI) was engaged on the design and construction of medium and heavy tank prototypes and it is probable that during the war certain serial production of tanks took place at the Henschel works in co-operation with Wegmann & Co. (see below).

KIEL (Schleswig Holstein)
54° 20' N. 10° 10' E: 470 miles: (260,000)
Kiel, the capital of Schleswig Holstein, is situated at the Southern end of the Kieler Förde (Hafen). This bay, about 11 miles long and a quarter to 4 j miles broad, is considered one of the best havens in Europe. On its Western side is the mouth of the famous Kaiser Wilhelm (or Kiel) Canal, and on the Eastern side, the mouth of the river Schv.entiene.
Kiel is the principal base of the German Ilavy and in all respects entirely a naval town, with dockyards, victualling and fuel stores, shipbuilding, engineering and armaments works. The harbour provides anchorage for a large fleet and quick access to the North Sea through the Kiel Canal, which Joins the river Elbe at Brunsbuttelkog.
Thanks to the canal, Kiel i3 also safely connected by water with Hamburg, Tftnflgn and the Dutch ports. The Canal's total length from Kiel (Holtenau) to Brunsbuttelkog on the Elbe is 53 nautical miles and its depth 37,07 feet.
The double lock gates of the Canal are at its Eastern (Holtenau) end and so are the two Easternmost bridges over the Canal, the Levensau bridge and the Prinz Heinrich bridge. Both bridges carry roads, and the local railway line between Kiel and Flensburg passes over the Levensau bridge.
Thoro are two principal target areas in Kiel:-
a)Stretching from Gaarden to Monckeberg along the Eastern side
of the Kieler Hofen. In this area are the three great shipbuilding yards, the big underground oil-storage plant and ammunition stores, and, in the centre of the area, the largest Naval arsenal in Germany. Of outstanding importance is the construction of U-boats in this area.
b)Immediately at and partly to the West of the Mouth of the Kiel Canal, in the Holtenau-Wick district is a group of less important targets. These targets consist of the Canal lock gates and bridges, the power station, oil-storage depots, and 3ome Naval equipment works.
A third series of outlying targets includes a plant producing thin shell and air leads, as well as assembling torpedoes, and other plants manufacturing torpedo components, aeronautical instilments, signalling apparatus, and light-metal products.
Fifteen miles Northwest of Kiel at Eckenforde there is believed to be a new and important torpedo factory.

50° 55' N. 6° 55' E: 310 miles: (912,000)

Cologne is the centre of trade, traffic, and political activity in the Rhine Province. Although it possesses important industrial establishments, its chief significance lies in its situation at the crossing of a number of trade routes.
It is the main railway-centre in the Rhineland, and a very important inland port.
The geographical position of Cologne has been the chief factor in determining the nature of its industry. Its proximity to the Ruhr coalfields and its rail, road, and river transport facilities have caused the growth of firms specialising in light and heavy engineering, chemicals, building, and textiles; in peace-time Cologne was also noted for its luxury products, including chocolate and perfumery.
Since 1939 there has been an expansion of certain engineering works and other factories engaged on war production. These are concentrated mainly in Ehrenfeld, Kalk, and Mülheim to the East of the city on the right bank of the Rhine. Other industrial districts with a fair number of important war factories are Sülz, Bayenthal, Poll, Deutz, Nippes, Riehl, and Niehl. Further important industrial concerns are to be found in the outlying districts of Heumar, Porz, Rondorf, Hürth, Kalscheuren, Knapsack-Goldenberg, Berrenrath, and Brauweiler.
The built-up area of Cologne itself is of no importance from a purely industrial point of view, as it is composed mainly of residential areas with the appropriate shops, offices, and wholesale houses.
The population figure of 912,000 includes the outlying townships mentioned above.

The complex covers an area of about one-third of a square mile and is the largest concentration of thermal generating plant in Germany, having a total capacity of
820 MW. Brown coal is obtained from the neighbouring mines "Vereinigte Ville" and Berrenrath. Adjacent to the mines is a carbide plant which in 1936 had a capacity of 50,000 tons per annum.
R.W.E. Transformer StationBrauweiler(l+)
Covering an area of about 100 acres, this is the largest installation of its kind in Europe, and probably the largest sub-station in the world. There are 3 bus-bar systems for 220 kV and 5 for 110 kV. The main switching control of the turbo-generator sets at the Goldenberg generating station is carried out here, and the buildings contain a special generator set for line-testing as well as what was, before the var, the main control-roan of the R.W.E. There are A interbus transformers for 220/110 kV, one of which has a capacity of 80 MW., while the other three have individual capacities of 48 MW.
The plant also includes smaller transformers for local supply. The station is connected to Koblenz by a double circuit 380/220 kV line, and to Knapsack, Herdecke,
Wesel, and possibly Fortuna by 220 kV lines.
110 kV lines run to Knapsack, Osterrath,
Wesel, Funlingen, Kupoersteg, Hrftwerk and probably to Fortuna. The station therefore controls upwards of lg million ktf, a high proportion of the power consumption of the Ruhr. Information received states that connection has been established with the Liege-Bressoux power-station and thereby with the Belgian Grid.

Before the amalgamation in 1926 H.I.A.G. headquarters were in Konstanz together with the reassert laboratories. Before the war the works were known to be engaged on producing chemicals based on ethyl alcohol as the raw material: this is presumed to have now ceased. Wood distillation was one carried out on a considerable scale but, in view of the present unimportance of this product, production of it may have ceased. This remains, however, an important centre for developing chemical processes.

50° 20' N. 18° 10' E: 800 miles: (15,000)
Kosel is on the right bank of the Oder 25 milee West of Gleiwitz. It is a railway Junction of importance to th^ coalmining and heavy industries of Upper Silesia. There is a large inland harbour serving the waterborne coal traffic from Upper Silesia which is here loaded on to the Oder barges.
The Klodnitz Canal (now renamed Adolf Hitler Canal), which was nearing completion in 1939, leaves the Oder at Kosel and leads to Gleiwitz where an extensive coal trans-shipment port has been constructed. This canal has probably reduced the importance of Kosel as regards coal trans-shipment but on the other hand Kosel ha3 acquired additional value as an inland port owing to its proximity to the synthetic-oil plants at Blechhammer and Deschowitz.

Kruppamflhle is in Upper Silesia 10 miles East of Oppeln and near to the railway station of Keilerswalde on a branch railway leading from Oppeln to Tamowitz (in Poland) and within 3 miles of the former Polish frontier. Apart from the explosives factory mentioned below there is no industrial development but the pre-war population will now have been largely increased presumably by the erection of workers' camps.

Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H.Kruppamflhle(2)

/The
KRUPPAMÖHLE (Contd.)
Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H. (contd.)
The factory covers a large area and is believed to be well equipped; but, owing to its bad strategic situation in close proximity to the former Polish frontier, it does not appear to have been much used for military purposes until some time after the invasion of Poland. Ground reports since that date suggest that the factory has now become of great importance, and although tnere is no air reconnaissance to confirm this, the reports must be considered of substance in view of the strategic situation of the plant, which is now as favourable as it was at one time dangerous.
It has been reported that the factory manufactures hexanitrodiphenylaadne, tetryl and T.N.T., and that it has its own nitric-acid plant. It has also been reported that the factory makes nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose. It is not common practice to manufacture high explosives and propellant explosives in the same plant, but since the Kruppamühle factory was used for many years for the production of raining explosives, it probably has a nitroglycerine plant, and for this reason a propellants section may have been developed.
