    THE BOMBER'S BAEDEKER (Guide to the Economic Importance of German Towns and Cities) 2nd (1944) Edition. PART I AACHEN-KÜSTRIN Enemy Branch, (Foreign Office and Ministry of Economic Warfare).
    <pb n="PREFACE" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454133"/>
    1. The 1944 edition of the "Bomber's Baed [xxx] revised and amplified version of Part III [xxx] edition, which it replaces. It has been ext [xxx] scope to cover all towns in Germany (regardless of size) which are of any industrial significance, and it has been possible to expand the number
    of industrial establishments listed in each town. Information relating to the activities of particular factories has been revised in the light of the latest available intelligence. 2. As in the previous edition, enterprises have been grouped under
    fourteen industrial headings as follows:- 1. Transportation 2. Public Utility Services 3. Solid Fuels 4. Liquid Fuels and Substitutes 5. Iron, Steel, and Ferro-Alloys 6. Non-Ferrous Metal Smelting, Refining, and Manufacture 7. Aircraft and Aero-engines 8.
    Shipbuilding 9. Other Engineering and Armament Industries 10. Chemicals and Explosives 11. Textiles, Rayon, Pulp and Paper 12. Rubber and Tyres 13. Leather 14. Food industries 3. The descriptions of activities and the figures in the column entitled "Priority" are
    intended only as a general guide to the size and relative importance of the individual undertakings. The basis on which the "Priority" ratings have been allotted is as follows:- 1+ Factories of outstanding importance in the German war effort. 1 Major
    plants in major industries 2 Minor plants in major industries or Major plants in minor industries 3 Factories of relatively small importance in the German war effort. - Factories which are almost certainly of little importance in the German war
    effort and establishments concerning which the available information is not sufficient to enable any priority rating to be allotted.
    <pb n="ii" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454134"/>
    Some of the works included without priority are new establishments the activities of which are uncertain; some of them would doubtless rank for inclusion in one of the four priority groups if full information were available. In allotting priorities
    account has been taken of the damage inflicted in area attack only in cases where the productivity of the factory concerned appears to have been permanently affected. In other cases factories are assessed on the basis that they have been fully
    repaired and are fully active. Owing to the speed with which repairs are put in hand in some cases, it did not seem practicable to give weight to damage which may prove to be temporary in assessing priorities which are intended for long-term
    reference. The priority rating of a factory in the Bomber's Baedeker consequently does not necessarily reflect its current importance and should not be used for the purpose of appreciations without reference to its current damage status. If the
    demand from users justifies it, however, periodical statements can be issued to show the current status of damaged factories as well as other amendments. 4. Owing to its increased size it has been necessary to bind the new edition in two parts, of
    which the first includes, in alphabetical order, the towns AACHEN to KÜSTRIN; and the second the towns LAHR to ZWICKAU. Each part is accompanied by maps showing:- a) All towns covered by the 1944 edition of the Bomber's Baedeker. b) The method of
    division of the industrial area of the Ruhr into fourteen districts. An index is in course of preparation. 5. Enquiries relating to this report should be addressed to:- E.B.3 Enemy Branch (F.O. and M.E.W.) Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, W.1.

    <Description>Aachen is an important railway junction on one of the main routes from North-West Germany into Belgium and France. It is the centre of a large coal-mining area, and many of the companies exploiting these mines have their administrative
      offices in the town. In peace-time textiles formed the main industry in Aachen proper. There are a large number of spinning and weaving mills, many of which were closed early in the war. The leading firms of Aachen's engineering and rubber industry are
      mentioned below. The town has been heavily damaged by bombing, and the production of several of these firms reduced, but much of the industrial damage, particularly to the main factories, has been repaired. The industries are mainly grouped in the North
      East corner of the town along the Jülicherstrasse, and in the Rothe Erde district, east of the town centre. Several of the textile mills in the Jülicherstrasse, which have been closed down, are now said to be used as dummies. The central part of the
      town is closely built, and has largely preserved its mediaeval character.
    </Description>
    <Transportation>
      Railway Junction Aachen-West (2) The main line Westwards from Cologne passes round the Southern edge of the town centre and crosses an important viaduct immediately to the East of the main railway station. At this station the line divides, one branch
      leading to Verviers and Liege, 25 miles West of Aachen, and the second leading Northwards round the town centre to the Aachen-West Station, near to which, a second important track leads by another route to Liege. From the Aachen-West Station, a
      main line leads North East to Krefeld and the Ruhr. These are the trunk lines which connect the industrial Rhineland direct with Antwerp and, through the Meuse valley, with North Eastern France. Further important branch lines lead from Aachen North
      East to Maastricht and Holland, and, from the Nordbahnhof Station, to Jülich and the coal mining region to the North East of the town. Marshalling Yards Aachen-West (2) Immediately to the North West of the Aachen-West Railway Station is the
      largest of the town's goods yards, with marshalling yards capable of handling 3,000 wagons per 24 hours. There are other goods stations immediately to the West of the main railway station, and in the Rothe Erde district to the East of the town.

    </Description>
    <Chemicals_and_Explosives>Dynamit A.G. nr. Allendorf (2) This factory is operated by DYNAMIT A.G. It has been constructed in the course of the present war. It has been reported by ground sources as being of exceptionally great size, and as being
      associated with a variety of activities. Photographic cover of September, 1941,suggests that the plant is engaged primarily in the production of finished propellant powders, but does not show it to be extremely large. On the other hand, a variety
      of reports received in 1942 and 1943 suggest that great extensions have been made during the last two years, the proposed completion date being given as September, 1943. In view of the number of such reports, it must be assumed that a very
      considerable powder factory now exists at this site, but it is not possible to give an estimate of its capacity. The factory is situated near Kassel slightly to the east of Allendorf village.</Chemicals_and_Explosives>

    <Description>General Introduction Berlin, the capital of the German Reich, and the third largest city in the world, is not only the political and economic administrative centre of Germany, but ranks also as the most important industrial and
      manufacturing city on the Continent of Europe. The suburbs and built-up area extends from East to West for some 20 miles, and from North to South approximately 17 miles. The administrative boundaries have been extended by the inclusion of surrounding
      districts to give a total area of 345 square miles. The chief industrial areas lie firstly, to the North-west, including Spandau, Siemenstadt, Wedding, Tegel, and Reinickendorf, and secondly, to the South and South-east including
      Marienfelde, Tempelhof, and Johannistal. There are other well-established industrial areas, such as Lichtenberg and Schöneberg, which are respectively in the eastern and southern quarters of the city. Further industrial extension is taking place in
      various outlying portions of the administrative area. The course of the river Spree, which is navigable, runs approximately from South-east to North-west through the centre of the city. At Spandau it joins the Havel, which flows from North to South
      along the western border of Berlin. The Teltow canal, which leaves the Spree near Treptow and runs through the Southern outskirts of Greater Berlin, joins the Havel near Potsdam and forms a link to relieve the water-borne traffic through the centre of
      the city. Great use has been made of the waterways around Berlin in order to connect the capital with the Elbe and the Oder. Large inland harbours have been constructed. The most important of which is the Westhafen, where 70 large ships can be loaded
      simultaneously. The Westhafen is connected with the Spree and with the Havel, which it joins at Spandau. From the Havel (North-west of Berlin) ship canals have been built giving direct access in the East to the Oder, and in the West to the Elbe. By this
      means navigable waterways connect Berlin directly with Stettin and the Baltic, and with Hamburg. The main railway artery between Western and North-eastern Europe runs through Berlin. There are three large railway stations on this East to West line. In
      addition main lines radiate from five other terminal railway stations to all parts of Germany. The local and suburban traffic is served by the electric Stadt- und Ringbahn, the extensive network of which extends over the whole area. This is supplemented
      by the large system of the Hoch- und Untergrundbahn, which runs partly underground and partly as an elevated railway, and by the tramway and bus services. All the leading firms have administrative offices in Berlin. These are largely concentrated in the
      central city area between Alexanderplatz and the Eastern end of Unter den Linden, and also in the neighbourhood of the Potsdammerplatz. Running South from the Western end of Unter den Linden is the Wilhelmstrasse, in which are situated the Chancellery,
      the War Office, the Air Ministry and other Government departments.
      <pb n="32a" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454167"/>
      The principal shopping centres of Berlin, which contain several large department stores, are Leipzigerstrasse, Alexanderplatz, and Tauentzienstrasse, in Charlottenburg. Industries The firmly established and significant position held by the industries of
      Berlin within the German productive machine is primarily due to their scope and diversity, both of which have been further developed during the war. The electro-technical industry (including radio) still maintains its important and leading position and
      is represented by large firms of world-wide repute such as the A.E.G., Siemens and Halske A.G., Siemens Schuckert A.G., and Telefunken Ges. für Drahtlose Telegraphie m.b.H., Osram G.m.b.H., and others. The general engineering industry is also of
      substantial importance, as is shown by the well-known firms engaged in it, such as Rheinmetall Borsig A.G., Ambi-Budd Presswerke G.m.b.H., Deutsche Industriewerke A.G., Berliner Maschinenbau A.G. (vormals L. Schwartzkopff), and Daimler-Benz A.G.;
      it is, in fact, Berlin's second-largest branch of industry. The aircraft industry is represented by B.M.W., Dornier, Heinkel and Focke-Wulf, and general engineering by numerous makers of precision tool and of precision and optical instruments.
      Berlin's chemical, clothing, and food industries, are also of more than local importance. Industrial Areas The chief industrial areas are located outside the Ringbahn, along the water and railway routes. These routes are arranged in three main belts:-
      the river Spree and the canals associated with it; the railway which encircles the outskirts of the compact built-up area, i.e., the Ringbahn; and an outer ring of conmunications which consist of the Havel and Tegel See to the West, the Teltow
      canal from Potsdam to Köpenick to the South, and the Industrie Bahn to the North from Tegel to Lichtenberg. An important feature of the three outstanding industrial areas is that there are only small residential areas in their immediate vicinity. In
      order of importance these are:- (1) Spandau, Charlottenburg, and Siemenstadt. This west-central part of Berlin is of the highest importance. Here there are very big blocks of factory buildings and also a special port. Among others, the electrical
      equipment and cableworks of Siemens and Halske A.G., Siemens Schuckert A.G., A.E.G. Turbinenfabrik, the Ges. für Elektrische Unternehmungen L. Loewe A.G., Osram G.m.b.H., and the B.M.W. are located there. The second and third largest of the BEWAG
      power stations are also in this area. (2) Treptow and Schöneweide. The manufacture of electrical equipment of all kinds is predominant within this area, and, although the A.E.G. has its largest individual plant at Brunnenstrasse, Wedding, the three
      most important electrical equipment and cable works of the company are to be found here. The most important of Berlin's non-ferrous metal plants and the main works of the important Accumulatoren Fabrik A.G. (A.F.A.)
      <pb n="33" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454168"/>
      are located in the Schöneweide district. There are other engineering works, motor vehicle and metal works. The largest of the BEWAG power stations is at Rummelsburg, near the Treptow area. (3) Tegel, Wittenau, and Reinickendorf. Important engineering and
      armament-production plants are to befound here. The most prominent of these are the Dornier and the Heinkel air-craft-components factories, the Argus aero-engine factory, Maschinenfabrik Prometheus G.m.b.H., and the Deutsche Waffen- und Munitions-Fabriken A.G.
      To the North there are many snail and scattered factories, the chief of which are at Lichtenberg, where Siemens Planiawerke and a number of other engineering works are located. To the South, at Mariendorf, Tempelhof and Britz, the chief
      factories lie on the South side of the Tempelhof airfield. Industries are also to be found on the Eastern outskirts of Neukölln. The suburban areas, most of which lie far outside Berlin, have been developed mainly during the last twenty years. As a rule
      they are largely residential, but in some cases industrial development has taken place. The greatest extensions have been made along the railways to the North-west towards Hennigsdorf and Oranienburg; to the North-east to Bernau: to the East beyond
      Mahlsdorf: to the South-east beyond Köpenick to Wildau; to the South to Lichtenrade: and to the South-west around the South of the Havel See to Potsdam.

      is supplied from external sources chiefly by the EWAG and the MEW systems. The BKL (BEWAG) controls all the main power stations in the city. The total capacity of the generating stations is 1,250 MW. External Supply There are two main outside systems
      of supply to the city. The first, the EWAG system, supplies current from Golpa-Zschornewitz and Trattendorf. These lines enter Berlin at Spandau and at Rummelsburg and thence are linked up to the BKL (BEWAG) system. Two lines come from Trattendorf;
      one skirts the northern suburbs and enters at Spandau, the other connects with BKL (BEWAG) system at Friedrichsfelde. The other is the MEW system, which encircles Berlin and introduces current from the power stations at Finkenheerd, Finow, and
      Hennigsdorf. Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG)- A.G. "Deutsche Edison" was founded in 1883 and in the following year was granted a concession to supply electrical current to part of the city of Berlin. This concession was transferred to the
      Städtische Elektrizitätswerke on its formation. Later, this company became the Berliner Elektrizitätswerke (BEW), and the concession was extended to cover the whole of the city of Berlin. In 1915 the city itself took over the direction of the firm
      under the name Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Berlin (STEW), but this was again altered in 1923 to Berliner Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Akt. Ges. (BEWAG). In 1931 the Berliner Kraft- und Licht-Aktiengesellschaft (BKL) was formed to administer the
      electrical installations owned directly by the city and those owned by BEWAG. The BEWAG capital was transferred to the new company and two other Berlin companies - Elektrowerke A.G. (EWAG) and Preussische Elektrizitäts Aktiengesellschaft- also became
      shareholders of the new company. Finally, in 1934, BEWAG and BKL were completely amalgamated to form the present Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG) - A.G. In 1938, BKL (BEWAG) - the new company - acquired the firm of Elektrizitätswerk Südwest A.G.
      (ESA) and so widened its territorial interests to Schöneberg, Wilmersdorf and
      <pb n="35" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454174"/>
      Schmargendorf. In the same year, as a result of an agreement made in 1928, it acquired from Märkisches Elektrizitätswerk A.G. (MEW) territorial interests in Dahlem, Lankwitz, Lichtenrade, Mariendorf, Südende, and Tempelhof.
      Thus BKL (BEWAG ) acquired the interests in the whole of the city as far as the small outlying districts of Wannsee and Buch. The company claims that this is the largest system of electrical manufacture and distribution in any one city in the world.
      BKL (BEWAG) power station Klingenberg (1+) This is the largest of the thermal power stations owned by the Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG) -A.G., which supply electricity to the Berlin area. Built in 1926/28, it operates on base load and has an installed
      capacity of 270 MW. but is designed for an ultimate capacity of 540 MW. It is situated on the North bank of the river Spree in the South-east of the city on a site of 50 acres; the main control room for the BKL (BEWAG) system is in the
      nine-storied office block which also houses large water tanks on its top floor. From a 30 kV switch house at least 48 three-phase 30 kV underground cables are operated in pairs and are connected to different substations in the Berlin area. There is
      also a 30 kV connection to the adjacent 81 MW. Rummelsburg station. BKL (BEWAG) power station Berlin-West (1+) This station is the second largest of the BKL (BEWAG) system and has an installed capacity of 228 MW. Built in 1929/1932, it is situated on
      the North bank of the river Spree in the western area of the city near the Siemens works at Siemenstadt. It was originally operated mainly to supply part of the Berlin day load, the night load being supplied by the Klingenberg station and by
      long-distance transmission from the large brown-coal-fired stations at Golpa-Zschornewitz, Trattendorf, Lauta, Finkenheerd, and elsewhere. The small Unterspree power station is situated 300 yards to the South-west, on the bank of the Spree. The main
      supply at 30 kV from the station is through underground cables to the Berlin city network via the 30 kV switch house. Supplies are also given direct to the nearby Siemens works. In addition to auxiliary supplies some small local supplies are probably
      given at 6.3 kV via the 6.3 kV switch house. BKL (BEWAG) power station Charlottenburg (1) This thermal power station, owned by BKL (BEWAG), has an installed capacity of 109 MW. Built in 1900, it was completely reconstructed in 1925 in two
      sections, of which one, with a capacity of 59 MW., operates on base load, while the other plant, which has a capacity of 50 MW., meets the peak load. It is situated in the western area of the city, on the North bank of the
      <pb n="36" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454175"/>
      river Spree. There is a 30 kV substation containing twelve 6/30 kV transformers of a total capacity of 116 MW. and one 30/3 kV inter-bus transformer of 8 MW. capacity. Local supplies are
      connected by underground cables to Spandau, Knie, the Siemens works, Moabit, and to the nearby 100 kV. substation. The 100 kV substation connected the Berlin 30 kV underground cable system with the 100 kV transmission system. One 100 kV line goes to
      Spandau, 6 miles to the North-west, and one to Moabit, from there continuing to Friedrichsfelde substation (9 miles East of Charlottenburg). The electrical output is supplied to Berlin. Steam is also supplied at 281 lbs/sq. in. for a
      district-heating system. BKL (BEWAG) power station Rummelsburg (1) This station is situated in Rummelsburg, a suburb in the South-east of Berlin, on the North bank of the river Spree within 1/2 mile of the Klingenberg station and has an installed
      capacity of 81 MW. A 100/30 kVA substation close to the generating plant transforms 100 kV supplies from the EWAG grid to 30 kV for local distribution. One 100 kV double-circuit line goes to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 4 miles to the North, and
      one to Golpa-Zschornewitz. The substation serves for local distribution at 30 kV rather than for supplying electricity externally. A 6/30 kV substation connects the 100/30 kV substation to the generating station, and contains at least two 6/30 kV
      transformers each of 18 MW. capacity; it connects the generating station to the 30 kV grid of the Berlin area and with the 100/30 kV substation it also serves for local distribution at 6 kV. BKL (BEWAG) power station Moabit (2) This is one of the
      oldest stations of the BKL (BEWAG) system supplying the Berlin area and has an installed capacity of 81 MW. It is operated for peak load and standby purposes. It is situated in the North-west central district on the Schiffahrts-Kanal and consists of 2
      parts; these are composed of a large number of reconditioned old units or replacements, which made identification of plant difficult. A substation for 100/30 kV steps down the supplies received through the 100 kV grid for distribution over the
      Berlin 30 kV grid. The substation is partly open air and partly in the old engine house; it contains at least 5 transformers each of 16 MW. Long distance 100 kV lines pass to Spandau, 7 miles distant, and to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 8 miles
      East of Moabit. A 6/30 kV substation gives supplies to the Berlin 30 kV grid. Local distribution is also at 6 kV.

      BKL (BEWAG) power station Wilmersdorf (2) This station on the BKL (BEWAG) system is situated at Wilmersdorf, a South-western suburb of Berlin close to the Rudolstädterstrasse, and has an installed capacity of 62 MW. This station was built by ESA
      in about 1905 and supplies the South-western area of Berlin. It is believed that the Wilmersdorf station is now used by BKL (BEWAG) for standby purposes only. An A.C./D.C. converter plant is attached to the station. The city of Berlin is supplied at
      6.6. kV and at lower voltages, and supplies are also given to the underground railways. It is possible that this station has been connected by BKL (BEWAG) to the 30 kV Berlin grid and that a 30/6 kV substation has been added to serve as a local
      distribution centre. BKL (BEWAG) power station Spandau (1) This station on the BKL (BEWAG) system is situated on the Havel See near Spandau, a North-west suburb of Berlin and has an installed capacity of 56 MW. The generating plant is used for standby
      and peak load only. One double ciruit line goes to Trattendorf, one to Brandenburg (there connecting to Golpa-Zschornewitz and Diesdorf), and one to Charlottenburg. There is a 100 kV connection to Henningsdorf (5 miles to the North). Local supplies
      are given at 6 kV, and to the Berlin grid at 30 kV. This station contains one of the main substations in Berlin. It has at least two 100/30 kV transformers, each of 16 MW. capacity and transforms the supplies received from the 100 kV grid to 30 kV
      for local distribution. It is the terminus of the 220 kV line which was partially constructed before the war and is now probably completed; starting at Brauweiler, the line reaches Spandau via Koepehenwerk, Bielefeld, Lehrte, Harbke, Diesdorf
      (Magdeburg), and Brandenburg; a distance of 385 miles by this route. EWAG switch station Friedrichsfelde (2) This important switch station is owned by EWAG and is situated on the east side of the city. Two 100 kV lines from Golpa-Zschornewitz and
      Trattendorf power stations pass to Berlin. It is also connected to the Moabit and Rummelsburg transforming stations. The elimination of this station would seriously affect the city's external supplies and it is, therefore, an important target.

      II GAS SUPPLY (N/A) General Up to 1939 gas supply in Berlin was undertaken by two companies, the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G., with works at Charlottenburg Danziger Str. Lichtenberg Neukölln Tegel leased to the company by the Municipality, and
      the Gasbetriebsgesellschaft A.G., a subsidiary of the Deutsche Gasgesellschaft A.G., with works at Gitschinerstr. Schöneberg Mariendorf In 1936 the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke sold 390,600,000 cu. m. of gas and the Gasbetriebsgesellschaft 133
      million cu. m. In 1939 the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke (Gasag) took over from the Deutsche Gasgesellschaft the operation of its three Berlin works, and thus unified gas supply in the city. In Greater Berlin there still remained, however, two
      independent municipal gas-distributing concerns, those at Niederbarnim and Teltow. Of these the former obtains gas from the GASAG, and the latter from the Potsdam works of the Deutsche Continental-Gas-Gesellschaft. Municipal Gasworks Charlottenburg
      (2) The gasworks is leased by the Municipality to the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G. and is situated just East of Jungfernheide Station. It is bounded in the North by the railway, East by the Verbindungskanal, and South by Gausstrasse. The area of
      the site is 13 1/2 acres. Maximum daily capacity is estimated at 300,000 cubic metres of gas per day, while normal annual output is about 60 million cubic metres. Electricity supply is taken from the town supply at 3,000 volts A.C., which is converted
      to 220 volts (D.C.) for the old part of the works, to 380 volts (A.C.) for power, and to 220 volts (A.C.) for lighting. Water is drawn from the adjacent Canal. Municipal Gasworks Danziger Str. (2) The gasworks is leased by the Municipality to the
      Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G. and is situated immediately to the West of Weissensee Station; it is bounded in the North by the railway, South-west by Danziger Strasse, and South-east by Greifswalder Strasse. The area of the works is 24 hectares.
      <pb n="39" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454179"/>
      Maximum daily capacity is estimated at 370,000 cubic metres of coal gas and 100,000 cubic metres of water gas. Electricity is taken from the town supply at 6,000 volts and transformed at the works to 220 volts. Water is obtained from 2 wells by
      pumps. Municipal Gasworks Lichtenberg (2) The gasworks is leased by the Municipality to the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G. and is located East of the river Spree and just South of Rummelsburg goods station. It also adjoins the Klingenberg
      power station. The plant has been completely rebuilt since 1934. Maximum daily capacity is estimated at 300,000 cubic metres per day; annual output is probably between 90 and 100 million cubic metres. There is a by-product plant for sulphate of
      ammonia. Municipal Gasworks Neukölln (2) The gasworks is leased by the Municipality to the Berlin Städtische Gaswerke A.G. and is located in the angle formed by the Schiffahrtskanal just North of Kaiser Friedrichstrasse station. It is bounded on
      the North by the canal, on the East by the railway, and on the South by the Kaiser Friedrich Strasse. There are 2 holder stations, one at Rannerstrasse (4 holders) just South-west of the gasworks, the other at Fichtestrasse (4 holders) which is
      immediately East of Kaiser Friedrich Platz. The gasworks covers an area of approx. 75,000 square metres. Maximum daily capacity is 400,000 cubic metres of gas per day; normal annual output being about 100 million cubic metres. There is also a
      water-gas plant and a sulphate of ammonia plant. Municipal Gasworks Tegel (1) Leased by the Berlin Municipality to the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G. The gasworks is situated on the East side of the Tegeler See and stretches eastwards from the
      lake along the North side of Berbauer Strasse to the railway, South of Tegel station. Maximum daily capacity is estimated at 616,000 cubic metres of coal gas and 240,000 cubic metres of water gas. There are by-product plants for sulphuric acid
      ("chamber" process) and sulphate of ammonia. Electricity supply is taken from the town system at 6,000 volts and is converted to 470 volts for power and 220 volts for lighting. Water is obtained from artesian wells.

      Braunschweig, or Brunswick, on the river Oker, is the chief town of the State of the same name. It is situated on the fertile plain North of the Hartz Mountains and lies in the rich agricultural district of the Aller basin. The town is the principal
      marketing centre for the corn, sugar, vegetables and cattle of the area. The inner town is a well preserved survival of mediaeval days with many half-timbered houses. In early years Brunswick was a road junction on the trade route from Hamburg to
      Southern Germany and the town still retains its importance as a communications centre. It is on the railway midway between Magdeburg and Hannover with through connections to the Baltic and North Sea coast. Brunswick is linked by its harbour with the
      Mittelland Canal and thus has direct access to Germany's extensive inland waterways system. Formerly Brunswick's chief speciality was the preservation of foodstuffs and it is still an important supplier of the armed forces.
      <pb n="92" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454232"/>
      The town has, however, now become of outstanding importance owing to the development of the aircraft and engineering industries. There are two large aircraft works in the town and two equally important works in the outlying districts of Querum and
      Waggum which lie within the administrative area. The industrial plants in Brunswick are mainly grouped in the southern quarter of the town in the neighbourhood of the railway yards and in the northern outskirts where there are several factories
      chiefly engaged in engineering. Shortly before the war the Hermann Göring concern erected a huge steel plant in the village of Hallendorf some 8 miles South West of Brunswick. This plant is one of the largest of its kind in the Reich and the
      industrial importance of Brunswick increased still further after its construction. For this reason these works are included in the targets listed below, although they are situated well beyond the boundaries of the town. The plant is extensively
      provided with road and rail communications linking it through Brunswick with other parts of Germany.

    <Description>
      Breslau is the chief city of Silesia. It lies on the river Oder and is on one of the stain routes to Poland and the eastern front. The city is in two unequal halves divided by the Oder which flows through Breslau in several channels over which are
      numerous bridges. The larger portion, on the left bank, includes the old part of the town. Breslau is the chief industrial centre of eastern Germany and is important owing to its position near the Silesian coal and ore fields. Among its industries are
      engineering works including the largest railway wagon manufacturers in the Reich, non-ferrous metal plants dealing chiefly with aluminium, aircraft works textile factories, and iron foundries. There are also in this district numerous small chemical
      factories, grain silos and flour mills. In order to facilitate transportation of coal from Silesia to Stettin and other parts of Germany, a canal known as the Breitenbachfahrt canal has been built which, in conjunction with the Alte Oder, by-passes the
      northern outskirts of the city and joins the Oder some two miles to the N.W.

      The city of Danzig is on the river Vistula four miles from its mouth. From Danzig the Vistula flows northwards into the Baltic. Neufahrwasser the outer port of Danzig, is on the left bank close to the mouth of the river. In the northern quarter of
      Danzig proper, along the banks of the Vistula, are the important Schichau and Danziger Werft ship building yards. A cut-off in the river Vistula, known as the Kaiserhafen and about 1 1/2 miles long, stretches from the Eastern end of the ship building area
      across a bend in the Vistula, which it rejoins halfway between Danzig and the river mouth. The port of Danzig with its ship building and ship repairing activities, extends alongside these two waterways. The principal docks are in the Holm, the island
      formed by the Kaiserhafen and the bend of the Vistula. The town itself is divided by the stream of the Mottlau, a tributary of the Vistula. The north-west quarter constitutes the old city, with the main railway station on its western border. Two
      branches of the railway run from the main station west of the river Vistula to Neufahrwasser. A separate branch leaves the main line south of Danzig, encircles the city to the east, and serves the ports on the Kaiserhafen and the Holm Island as well as
      the railway repair shops on the right bank of the river. There are a number of large flour mills and various industries in the central city area and in the Niederstadt (the south-east quarter of the town), but it is as a ship and submarine building
      centre and as a naval and submarine base and arsenal that Danzig occupies a position of major importance.

      Marshalling Yards Kaiserhafen (3) Railway Repair Shops Kaiserhafen (2) These extensive yards and installations are on the right bank of the Vistula near to the Southern end of the Kaiserhafen. The railway sidings serving the quays and docks of the
      port area radiate from here. It is estimated that 2,000 workers are employed in the repair shops which before the war were the chief locomotive and rolling stock works supplying the Polish railways. Ground intelligence suggests that in 1942 about
      1,800 workers were employed, and that this plant was principally engaged on repair and maintenance of main line locomotives. Goods Station Olivaer Tor (3) Immediately north of the main railway station are large marshalling and goods yards from which
      the branch lines radiate to the Schichau and the Danziger Werft ship building yards. Repair Shops Werftgasse (3) The railway repair works of the Danziger Werft and Eisenbahnwerkstätten A.G. are between the

      merchant ships and tankers and all kinds of ship repair. They build submarines, and in 1943 were reported to be completing three monthly. They have also undertaken construction of floating docks and three of these, each with lifting capacity of
      20,000 tons, were turned out during the early months of 1943. Danziger Werft Danzig (1) The second large Danzig ship building conern is also in the northern part of the city further upstream from and almost adjacent to the Schichau works. The yards of
      the Danziger Werft A.G. are on both banks of the Vistula, the area on the southern bank being the larger of the two. Their capacity is similar to that of Schichau and they are also constructing submarines. Assault craft have been reported to be a
      speciality of these yards. Wojan Schiffswerft Troyl (3) Klawitter Schiffswerft Strohdeich (3) These are two minor ship yards probably engaged on building and repair of small coastal vessels. Klawitter is on the tongue of land on the right bank of the
      Mottlau where it joins the Vistula, and Wojan is on the opposite bank of the Vistula near the suburb of Troyl. Naval Base Der Holm (1) The chief naval establishment and arsenal are on the Holm Island, where there are two large and several smaller
      docks. The submarines using this harbour are moored along the bank of the Kaiserhafen where two or three large ships are permanently moored to serve as living quarters. There are a large number of buildings on the Holm serving as naval supply sheds
      and oil storage. Close to the south end of the Kaiserhafen several buildings of cement have been constructed on the Holm which are thought to be submarine pens or repair installations.

      The area covered here extends in the North from Henrichenburg to Bergkamen including Waltrop, Lippholthausen and Lünen, covers Kamen and Holzwickede in the East; Horde to the South; and Westrich, Bodelschwingh and Ostrich in the West. The map showing
      these boundaries is inserted at the end of this book. Dortmund with 550,000 inhabitants is the largest and most easterly town in the Ruhr. It is one of the chief centres of heavy industry in Germany and besides the large steel works is full of smaller
      concerns engaged in engineering of all kinds. The town's geographical position at the eastern extremity of the Ruhr, at the terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal, and in the centre of the Westphalian coal fields make it one of the busiest commercial
      centres in Germany. Although most of the marshalling yards in the Dortmund district are relatively small it is, next to Duisburg, the principal transport centre of the Ruhr particularly for through traffic to Central, North and Eastern Germany. The
      harbour situated at the terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal is of particular importance. Dortmund proper has only one power station which though large is of local importance only. Though there are several electric power plants in the vicinity of the
      city they are all privately owned concerns of comparatively small capacity and concerned only with the pits or works to which they belong. Gas is obtained from the Ruhr Gas Grid. There is an important V.E.W. station at Lünen with a capacity of 135 MW.
      There are two important industrial area in Dortmund. The first lies on the western side of the town and contains the very important harbour and two marshalling yards and south of the harbour, the large steel works of the Dortmund Hörder Hüttenverein
      A.G. The second area lies to the north east of the city and consists of the huge Hoesch steelworks, the Hoesch-Benzin G.m.b.H. Fischer-Tropsch plant and a marshalling yard which envelopes the north western side of the steelworks; also within this area
      is the Minister Stein concern with coke ovens, a by-products plant, and the power plant. Scattered throughout the town are numerous plants of secondary importance, the majority of which are engaged on engineering. At Hörde, to the south-east of Dortmund
      lies the Dortmund Hörder Hüttenverein, a subsidiary of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and in its western portion the coking plant. In the north there are two important concerns; at Kamen a Fischer Tropsch plant, and west of Lünen on the Seiten Canal the
      Lippewerk of the Vereinigte Aluminium Werke A.G. Outside Dortmund there are numerous coke oven plants including "Hansa", the second largest in Germany, and several colliery concerns. To the extreme North West of the area is the ship-lift and the
      shaft lock at the junction of the Dortmund-Ems and Rhein-Herne canals.

      In peace time tobacco, chocolate and confectionery manufacture played a large part in Dresden's industrial activity; there are also a large number of light engineering works and makers of machinery which are now engaged on all kinds of war
      production, many of which are too small to be listed individually. Several important factories are making electric motors, precision and optical instruments and chemicals. The munitions workshops in the old arsenal occupy an extensive area to the North
      of Neustadt, along the railway to Klotsche, in the industrial region which extends past the aerodrome to the Dresdner Heide. In the Heide, a large heath, munitions are reported to be stored in quantities. Dresden is an important railway centre. The main
      connections between South and East Germany and the direct line from Berlin to Prague and Vienna pass through Dresden whence several branch lines lead to Leipzig and other parts of industrial Saxony. The river harbour is of considerable importance to the
      freight traffic of the Elbe. To the SW. of the town in the valley of the Weisseritz is the industrial town of Freital (dealt with under its own heading) and a small coal field which supplies the light industries that have been developed in Dresden. Along
      the northern bank of the Elbe between Dresden and Meissen are a number of industrial settlements which are outside the municipal area of Dresden. These have been dealt with separately under the town headings Radebeul, Coswig near Dresden, and Meissen.

    <Description>
      The area covered lies in the Western extremity of the industrial district of the Ruhr. It is traversed from South to North by the Rhine, on the West of which is flat lightly-wooded country with scattered villages and small towns, lying at the general
      level of 75 to 100 feet above sea level. On the East of the Rhine the country is much more thickly populated and rises eastwards to about 200 feet, except in the gap through which run the River Ruhr and the Rhine-Herne canal. To the North and South are
      extensive forests. Duisburg is by far the largest town in this district with a population of nearly 440,000 (including Hamborn). It lies on both sides of the mouth of the river Ruhr and includes the townships of Ruhrort, Hamborn, Wanheimerort,
      Huckingen, Rheinhausen, Wedau, Grossenbaum and Dinslaken. Duisburg owes its industrial importance and prosperity to the presence, in its immediate vicinity, of hard coal in very considerable quantities. This has accounted for the development of iron
      and steel, heavy engineering, and other industries and brought about the necessity for construction and repeated expansion of the Duisburg-Ruhrort Harbour situated at the mouth of the river Ruhr. Duisburg's situation at the confluences of the rivers
      Rhine and Ruhr and in the centre of the western concentration of the Ruhr industrial area gives it great importance from the point of view of transportation. Its main claim to fame is that it is here more than anywhere else in the Ruhr or Rhineland that
      the transfer of goods from rail to water or water to rail takes place, and it is this factor that has made Duisburg the greatest inland waterway harbour in Europe. The railway network at Duisburg has been constructed primarily to provide ample facilities
      to deal with the rail traffic originating from, or destined for the waterways; this function is fulfilled by the extensive marshalling yards at Ruhrort Hafen Neu Schultenhof, which handled about 14 million tons of traffic annually before the w ar. A
      second - and scarcely less important - function of the system is to accommodate the North-South and the West-East flow of land traffic; this is achieved by the marshalling yards at Duisburg main station, and, amongst others, those at Oberhausen West in
      the North-East (see under "Oberhausen"), at Wedau to the South-East, and at Hohenbudberg on the left bank of the river Rhine (see under "Uerdingen"). In addition, Duisburg lies on the Rhine-Herne Canal, which leaves the Rhine at this point and joins the
      Dortmund-Ems Canal near Datteln and thus links Duisburg by waterway with the North Sea at Emden and the Mittelland Canal at Bevergern. There are two harbours to deal with the waterborne traffic, which consists in the main of coal, coke, and finished iron
      and steel goods (outwards): iron-ore, grain and timber (inwards); the harbours are also important for storage reasons. There are no particularly important electrical power plants in this area. The Town Power Station has a capacity not exceeding 50 MW and
      is connected to the main R.W.E grid system through Brauweiler.
      <pb n="163" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454303"/>
      The Town Gasworks are adjacent to the Power Station. The principal industries are mining, the conversion of coal into coke, gas and the usual by-products, iron and steel manufacture, and heavy engineering. The coal and iron and steel industry is
      almost entirely in the hands of Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. and its subsidiary companies, the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerke A.G. which operates some of the largest pits and coke ovens, the August Thyssen Hütte A.G. which operates four great blast furnace
      plants, the Deutsche Eisenwerk A.G. which is responsible for blast furnaces at Hamborn, the Deutsche Röhrenwerk A.G. and Bandeisenwalzwerke A.G. (which controls the rolling mills at Dinslaken) and the Eisenwerk Wanheim G.m.b.H. These numerous and highly
      important industrial plants are spread over an extensive area stretching from the South West mainly along the East bank of the Rhine to Dinslaken in the North and extending East to the boundaries with Oberhausen and Mulheim.

      The villages of Düneberg and Krümmel lie to the North West and South East respectively of the small town Geesthacht (population 8,500). Both villages are of industrial importance on account of the two large works of the Dynamit A.-G. which are situated
      there.
    </Description>
    <Chemicals_and_Explosives>Dynamit A.-G. Düneberg (1) This factory is operated by Dynamit A.G., and is quite near the Krümmel factory, with which it is associated. In the last war the Düneberg factory was Germany's largest producer of nitrocellulose
      and nitroglycerine. Most of this production was sent to the Krümmel factory for the manufacture of powder. There has been very little ground information on the activities of this plant during the present war, and there is no air cover. Such reports as
      have been received suggest that it has attained at least its former activity, and it is probable that it bears the same relation to the Krümmel plant as formerly. On this basis it may be assumed that the nitrocellulose production is upwards of
      36,000 tons per annum, but it would be difficult to guess the nitroglycerine or diglycoldinitrate production, since it is unlikely that Germany will have concentrated her production of this class of explosive to so great a degree as in the last
      war, and at least one new factory engaged in this production has been identified.
      <pb n="178" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454318"/>
      Dynamit A.-G. Krümmel (1) This factory is operated by Dynamit A.G., and during the last war was the largest propellant powder factory in Germany, accounting for nearly one-third of the total German output of cordite, and also accounting for about 10
      per cent. of the total German production of Nitrocellulose. In the peace years this factory was allowed to continue operations, manufacturing small quantities of nitroglycerine (probably for mining explosives); it also introduced, strangely enough,
      the production of T.N.T. on a small scale (a little over 1,000 tons a year), and engaged in the production of nitrocellulose for celluloid and synthetic fibre production. There is very little information regarding the activities of the Krümmel
      factory in the present war, but it is clear that a very large labour force is now employed. Apart, however, from a report that its nitroglycerine or diglycol dinitrate production approaches 5,000 tons per annum, which is roughly the same as the
      production in the last war, there is little information as to its output. On the basis of the nitroglycerine or diglycoldinitrate output, it seems likely that this factory has achieved at least its last war importance, and may have considerably
      exceeded it. This would indicate a nitrocellulose output of about 20,000 tons a year. The factory lies on the banks of the Elbe, east of the village of Geesthacht. There is also probably a large propellant powder plant on this site.

      The area covered here lies on both sides of the river Rhine to the south-west of the Ruhr district. It includes the city of Düsseldorf with its main suburbs of Derendorf, Oberbilk and Unterbilk, Lierenfeld and Flingern and the townships of Rath,
      Ratingen, Gerresheim, Erkrath, Reisholz, Benrath, Nievenheim (including Stürzelberg) Heerdt (including Niederkassel and Oberkassel) and Lohausen (including Stockum). The city of Neuss on the western bank of the Rhine is to be found under its own heading
      and is not included in Düsseldorf. The total population for this area is 559,000 (1940). The city of Düsseldorf has a population of 528,000 (1940) and is the leading commercial city of western Germany. Situated on the eastern bank of the Rhine, it has
      exceptionally good transport facilities both by river and rail. It is furthermore Germany's third largest inland port, and therefore of particular importance as a transport centre. During and after the last war, Düsseldorf developed considerably and so
      far as the production of armaments and general engineering is concerned, it is as important as Essen or Duisburg. In addition Düsseldorf is the seat of the General Administrative Departments of practically all the important iron and steel, heavy
      engineering, and armament concerns in Rhine and Ruhr districts. The distribution of industry in the Düsseldorf area may be said to lie in 4 main areas:- i) The eastern and southern part of the city proper. This is a highly concentrated area containing
      large engineering works, machine tool makers, wire-drawing plant, and the municipal gas and electricity works. ii) The northern suburb of Derendorf and townships of Rath and Ratingen. Here are to be found extensive marshalling yards and highly
      important armament manufacturers. iii) The harbour area on the Rhine to the southwest of the city with docks, storage and engineering firms. iv) South of Düsseldorf at Reisholz and Benrath. Engineering and chemical works, oil refinery and storage,
      electricity works, electric resistance wire works, lead and zinc fabricators are all grouped in this area which extends in a south-westerly and north-easterly direction and embraces the townships of Nievenheim and Erkrath.

    <Public_Utility_Services>Städtische Elektrizitätswerke. Flingern (2) The Düsseldorf City Power Station consists of two generating stations sometimes known as Flingern I and Flingern II stations. They are situated on the same site and separated only by
      the common coal storage ground, and by a group of 6 cooling towers. Of the 9 Turbo generator sets installed before 1938 it is known that 4 are in station I and 5 in Station II. The two most recently installed sets may have replaced two older sets of
      smaller capacity. It is believed that a convertor or rectifier station is attached to station I to simply D.C. to the central part of Düsseldorf.

      There is a common 5/25 kV A.C. substation for both stations. A.C. supplies are given at 5 kV and 25 kV. D.C. supplies are given at 600 volts - probably for traction - and at low voltages, for the D.C. network of the central part of the city. It is
      believed that the station is connected by 25 kV cables to the Lierenfeld 110 kV substation in the South, and to the Rath 110 kV substation in the North of Düsseldorf. Both of these substations are connected to the 110 kV grid of the R.W.E. company. There
      are no long distance supplies. The installed capacity is 118 MW. Bergisches Elektrizitätswerk m.b.H. Reisholz. (1) This station operates on base load and supplies are given to the nearby industrial area of Dusseldorf as well as to the high voltage grid
      of the R.W.E. An oil refinery owned by the Phenania Ossag-company adjoins the station and a small chemical plant, possibly for hydrogen production, is situated among the station buildings. These two plants are probably large consumers of the
      electrical output of the station. In 1938 the existing turbo-generator sets had a total capacity of 75 MW. It is believed that there were two or three units with a total capacity of 15 MW and three or four units with a capacity of 15-20 MW each. In
      1939 two additional sets each of 20 MW capacity were installed by the A.E.G. The machine house is at present being further extended and it is possible that more generating plant is being installed. (Total installed caapcity 115 MW.) There is an indoor
      substation for local supplies which are probably given through medium and low voltage underground cables. Local supplies are given to the adjacent works mentioned above, and to the industrial area of Dusseldorf. There is a 110 kV outdoor substation in
      which at least 2 transformers are installed. Two 110 kV lines leave the station. One goes to the Erftwerk (Grevenbroich) aluminium plant of the VAWAG and crosses the Rhine immediately on leaving the station. The other goes to Lierenfeld substation near
      Düsseldorf. Städtische Gaswerke. Düsseldorf (3) The municipal gasworks lies adjacent to the municipal electricity works. In 1936 the works made 1,900 million cu. ft. and in addition sold (in Benrath only) 65 million cu. ft. bought from Ruhrgas A.G. There is

      Emden, situated on the right bank of the Ems estuary opposite the Dutch coast, is the most westerly of the German North Sea ports and the nearest to England. The surrounding country is flat, and low-lying, intersected by canals and almost entirely
      devoted to agriculture. Apart from its harbour and associated industry, Emden and the surrounding district is not industrially significant. Its position, however, as a terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and the Ems-Jade Canal connecting Emden with
      Wilhelmshaven makes it a valuable service port for the Ruhr, particularly in the handling of Swedish iron ore for which it is specially equipped. It is also important as a naval station, a base for mine-layers and mine-sweepers, and for its facilities
      for shipbuilding and ship repairs. There are four main harbours, the Outer Harbour, the Inner Harbour, the New Inner Harbour, and the Industry Harbour. Of these, only the Outer Harbour is tidal, the others being entered from the sea, either via the look
      at the entrance to the New Inner Harbour, or through that at the northern end of the Outer Harbour. The Outer Harbour is capable of accommodating the largest sea-going vessels at its quays. The New Inner Harbour, in which is handled a large
      proportion of Emden's traffic, is reached by the large ocean lock (260 m. long by 40 m. wide). On the south of this harbour is the Ore and Iron Quay; coal and coke are also dealt with at this quay. Adjacent to the New Inner Harbour on the north is the
      Industry Harbour with the Nordseewerke shipyard and a briquette factory. The harbour equipment includes a great variety of cranes, and good railway connections to the quays enable loading to be effected direct from truck to ship without the need of
      intermediate storage. Emden is supplied with electricity on the grid system. A grid and transformer station is situated at the eastern extremity of the Industry Harbour. A small power plant on the east quay of the Inner Harbour, at its southern end,
      supplies power for dock installations. Emden has no important local industries. Its value lies rather in its trade, which causes the port to rank high among German seaports. It is the import and export harbour for bulk goods to and from the eastern and
      central Ruhr, notably serving this district with supplies
      <pb n="201" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454341"/>
      of iron ore from Sweden. There is also an active trade in agricultural produce, cattle, timber, coal and coke, while it was in peace time an important base for the deep sea fishing fleet. On the east quay of the Outer Harbour are large grain
      warehouses and a silo. Submarines and small surface craft are constructed at the Nordseewerke.

      Port Area Emden South (2) Emden has four main harbours. These are the Aussen-Hafen, Binnen-Hafen, Neuer-Binnen-Haffen, and Industrie-Hafen. A new submarine harbour has been constructed on the south side of the Industrie-Hafen. The only harbour
      directly accessible from the sea is the Aussen-Hafen, the remainder being reached by means of locks. The largest of these is the Ocean Lock at the entrance to the Neuer-Binnen-Hafen which is 260 metres long by 40 metres wide. Iron ore, coal and coke,
      are dealt with at the quays situated on the South side of this harbour. The Dortmund-Ems and Ems-Jade Canals terminate in the Eastern quarter of the town and are connected by a third canal known as the Verbindungs-Kanal. Marshalling Yards Emden

      General The area covered by this report is in the central part of the Ruhr; it consists of undulating country varying from 100 to 400 ft. above sea level with some wooded area to the north and south. Essen includes within its boundaries a number of
      sprawling suburbs with a total population of 670,000; the original town and surrounding villages have long since outgrown their boundaries and industrialization has given the area a character not unlike that of an English mining district. Essen is
      the great armaments centre of the Ruhr. Its reputation as Germany's greatest armaments arsenal ("Die Waffenschmiede des Reichs" as the Germans call it) originates from World War I in the course of which the famous Friedrich Krupp works expanded on a
      scale unprecedented in history. In 1917/18 a peak figure of over 150,000 workers were employed by the Fr. Krupp A.G. undertaking, some 80,000 of whom worked at the main plant at Essen. But whereas Krupp throughout the last war remained the principal
      producer of armaments in the Reich it had, up to to the outbreak of World War II, to a great extent lost its dominating position in the field of German arma ents manufacture, partly as a result of the complete reorganisation of the works after the
      collapse of Germany's war machine in 1918 and in accordance with which several large departments were successfully switched over to commercial commodities such as locomotives, lorries, Diesel engines for heavy road transport, small ships diesels,
      forged drums for high-pressure boilers, wheels and axles for locomotives, railway trucks and wagons etc., and also due to the fact that other important armaments producers, particularly the Rheinmetall Borsig works at Derendorf near Düsseldorf (20
      miles S.W. of Essen), Germany's second largest armaments producers in the last war, have been considerably extended and today are probably of equal importance as armaments makers. There is no doubt that the main Essen works of Friedrich Krupp A.G.
      remained the largest individual armaments and heavy engineering plant in the Reich, but instead of being one vast arms producing centre, as was the case during the last war, it became rather a combination of factories producing a wide range of
      materials and articles, many of which, although of the utmost importance to Germany's war effort, are not of an armament nature. However, Krupp remains the principal if not only producer in Germany of heavy naval, coastal defence and railway guns.
      <pb n="208" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454348"/>
      It was estimated in 1942 that the total number of workers and employees operating in the various Krupp works was 175,000. This number was divided roughly as follows:- Armaments sections of the main works at Essen 35,000 Heavy engineering sections of
      the main works at Essen. 40,000 Krupp Gruson Works at Magdeburg (armaments and heavy engineering) 35,000 Coal mines, iron-ore mines, coke-oven plants, synthetic oil plants, etc. situated at various places in Western Germany 18,000 Friedrich Alfred
      Hütte steelworks near Duisburg 12,000 Friedrich Krupp iron and steel works, Essen, (situated several miles West of the main works). 5,000 Krupp Germania Werft, Kiel. (shipbuilding yards) 10,000 Administrative staff at the various works, holding and
      financing companies, distribution centres, trading companies, etc. 20,000 175,000 At the southern boundary of the district is the River Ruhr, which is navigable by smaller barges from Duisburg to Witten, east of Essen. Across the centre of the area run
      the Emscher Canal and the Rhine-Herne Canal. The former is used for drainage purposes and runs from Walsum on the Rhine to Dortmund. The latter is an important connecting link between the Rhine and the Dortmund-Ems Canal; along it passes traffic which
      has come down the Rhine and its tributaries to Duisburg-Ruhrort and by its junction with the Dortmund-Ems Canal the traffic passes on to the Mittelland Canal and so to the great towns of north Germany. Damage to any of the three locks would therefore
      have a serious effect on the industrial life of a great part of the country. It will be observed that many of the important industries of this district lie close to or on the canal harbours. The area is provided with large marshalling yards and a
      network of railways, so interconnected that it is difficult to pick out those of outstanding importance. It is probable, however, that the Osterfeld Marshalling Yard (see under "Oberhausen") handles a large proportion of the traffic between Duisburg and
      northern Germany. The other targetted yards in this area probably serve mainly as local yards. The most important electrical objective in this area is the Essen-Karnap 220 MW. R.W.E. electric power station situated a few miles north of Essen. This is
      the most important power plant in the Ruhr industrial area. There is also a 45 MW. R.W.E. station in Essen itself.
      <pb n="209" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454349"/>
      Although it is hardly possible to distinguish any areas as industrially more important than others, because any attempt to do so would leave out of account some very important targets, it may be said that the principal group of targets covered by
      this report lie within the area of Essen proper, and stretch north-westwards from Essen-town to the Rhine-Herne Canal. It includes the steel works of Friedrich Krupp A.G. as well as the vast arms, locomotives and general engineering works of that
      firm, besides large coal mines and coke-oven plants; the zinc smelters of A.G. des Altenbergs für Bergbau and Zinkhüttenbetrieb at Borbeck; the plastics works of Presswerk A.G.; the very important chemicals and non-ferrous metals works Th. Goldschmidt
      A.G. (now inactive, see under Non-Ferrous Metals); and finally the important railway traffic centre Essen-Verschiebebahnhof. During 1943, the town of Essen was largely devastated. Extremely severe damage was inflicted on the Friedrich Krupp works and it was
      thought that by the end of July 1943, output had been reduced to one third of capacity. Since then, some reconstruction has taken place, and by the end of 1943 output was reckoned at 40% of pre-raid capacity. The works of Theodore Goldschmidt A.G.
      were also severely damaged and are believed to be inactive (see under Non-ferrous Metals).

      pumps and compressors. They are believed to be important producers of submarine pumps. Prior to the war Balcke employed about 800 workers at their Frankenthal plant. Klein, Schanzlin and Becker A.G. and Kühnle, Kopp and Kausch A.G.
      Frankenthal (1) The KSB factory is a well known maker of pumps and compressors as well as of machinery for the chemical and textile industries. In 1939 the firm employed some 2,000 workers. The KKK works are well known builders of turbines,
      industrial ventilators, air purification plant, evaporators and a variety of apparatus for the chemical industry. In 1939 they employed more than 1,000 workers. Both the KSB and KKK works have been enlarged since 1939, and are now believed to be
      working in close association with eaoh other. It is possible that the nearby engineering works of Schnellpressenfabrik Albert, which was largely inactive prior to the war, has been incorporated into this industrial complex. According to reliable
      ground intelligence, the KSB and KKK works together now employ more than 5,000 workers and are partly, if not mainly, engaged on the manufacture of parts of new weapons or appliances for such weapons. Gusswerke A.G. Wormserstr. (-) This company

    <Description>General The area covered hereunder includes the town of Frankfort/Main proper as well as the outlying suburbs Höchst, Griesheim, Nied, Rödelheim, Heddernheim, Praunheim, Fechenheim, Mainkur, Oherrad, and Niederrad, together convering an
      area of 49,000 acres. The nearby town of Offenbach/Main, lying within the borders of the province Hesse, is dealt with separately under Offenbach. Frankfurt is the commercial, industrial and cultural metropolis of the Upper Rhineland, an important
      transport centre, and since 1933 also important as a military training centre with a large number of new and extensive barracks situated around the Friedberger Warte in the suburb Praunheim to the North of the town. Communications Frankfort is an
      important railway junction on the lines from Berlin to Basle, from Cologne via Nurnberg to Vienna, from Hamburg and Kassel and from Dresden and Leipzig to France and Switzerland. The river Main is sufficiently dredged to take heavy barge traffic several
      hundred miles up the river, thus making Frankfort one of the leading inland ports on the Rhein-Main-Danube canal route. Industry The largest industrial plants in the area are the chemical works of I.G. Farbenindustrie at Höchst and Griesheim-on-Main some
      5 miles west of the town. Within the built-up outskirts of Frankfort proper are the Adler Werke, important manufacturers of motor vehicles and military transport, and immediately adjacent the large works of Alfred Teves which in pre-war days produced the
      well known ATE refrigerators and were also the leading manufacturers in Germany of Lockhead brakes and piston rings. The Teves works have been enlarged considerably during the last four years and have replaced refrigerator production by the manufacture
      of retractable undercarriages for aircraft and a variety of other aircraft components. At Heddernheim, a North-Eastern suburb, is the important non-ferrous metal works of the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke formerly well known under the name of
      Heddernheimer Kupferwerke. To the war industry this plant is of particular importance as a prominent producer of air-screws.
      <pb n="228" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454368"/>
      Many other factories, the production of which is solely confined to the supply of Germany's war machine, are located within this town. Among these special war products are aircraft and motor-vehicle instruments, detonating apparatus for naval mines,
      precision measuring instruments, special electrical gear, including range finding apparatus for the Navy, small-arms-munition and so forth. Frankfort has also large grain stores, flour mills, power stations, and oil storage plants. In addition to the
      huge chemical plants at Griesheim and Höchst, more than twenty other chemical factories are located, within, or in the immediate vicinity of the town. Frankfort is often referred to as the centre of Germany's chemical industry. This is partly due to the
      fact that the I.G., Germany's great chemical trust, have their administrative headquarters here in the so-called I.G. Hochhaus. This is a very modern office building in the western section of the town where more than 3,000 officials, are housed. In
      addition Frankfort is also the headquarters of the "Degussa" Chemical concern (Deutsche Gold and Silber Scheideanstalt) another imortant chemical trust and of the Metallgesellschaft A.G., a large chemical and non-ferrous metal concern. Principal
      Industrial Areas Within or immediately adjacent to the built-up area of the town are a number of industrial targets of primary importance situated in two distinctly separate areas:- Area "A" - Stretching South from the Main Goods Yards to the River
      Main includes such important targets as the Adler Werke A.G. (vorm. Hch. Kleyer), building M.T., A.F.V.'s and A.F.V. components, M.G. and small-arms components; Fritz Gerner, making components for Messerschmitt fighters; Alfred Teves making M.T. and
      a/c components, piston rings, brakes, propellor shafts, valves etc., V.D.O. Tachometer making a/c and M.T. instruments; Hartmann und Braun making a/c and other instruments, gauges, etc.; and a number of small engineering works, as well as
      Peters-Union (Continental) making tyres and tubes and other rubber manufactures; as well as the three factories of I. and C.A. Schneider, largest slipper manufacturers in Germany. Also within area "A" is an important 58 MW power station. Area "B" - which
      stretches from the Marshalling Yard-Ost to the river Main, includes the East Harbour, Gaswerk-Ost; Messer and Co., making welding machines; a petroleum receiving depot, flour mills and grain storage plants; and the large works of Voigt and Häffner
      A.G. making switchgear and special electrical equipment. Roughly 1/2 mile North-West of area "B" is the important plant of Naxos Union one of the leading German makers of grinding wheels.

      Railway Repair Shops Nied (1) These very large railway repair shops are believed to be employed exclusively on the repair of locomotives. Reports suggest that some 4,000 - 5,000 workers were employed in two ten-hour shifts in 1943. Railway Repair
      Shops Frankfort-West (2) Reports suggest that this works, which is engaged on the repair of passenger coaches and goods wagons, was less active in 1943 than in 1941 when 2,000 workers were employed. Hauptgüterbahnhof Frankfort-West (2) These
      railway goods yards are situated in the western part of the town adjacent to a large marshalling yard. The area also includes the Reichsbahn customs house and a large number of storage depots with extensive facilities. Railway Marshalling Yards
      Frankfort/Ost (3) These yards are situated to the North of the East Harbour. In 1939 they had a capacity of 2,700 wagons per 24 hours. East Harbour Frankfort/Ost (3) The East Harbour was the larger and best equipped of Frankfort's two inland ports.
      In 1939 the area included a gas works, grain silos, oil storage depots and many storage plants for general merchandise but it was mainly used for the handling of the coal requirements of the town. During the past six months, many of the harbour
      installations and facilities have been destroyed by the R.A.F. West Harbour Frankfort (3) This part is mainly for the handling of grain, flour, other foodstuffs and general merchandise. The main facilities are the storage capacity of 100,000 tons.

      Städtisches Elektrizitätswerk Frankfort (2) This municipal thermal power is situated on the river Main in the Gutleut Strasse, to the S.W. of the central district of Frankfort/Main. Built originally in 1894, it has been successively extended, but the
      plant is old and the capacity is insufficient to meet the requirements of the city, so that a supplementary supply is imported from the Preussische Elektrizitäts A.G. (Preag.) and the R.W.E. Its installed capacity is 58 MW. There are 35 kV. lines
      connected to the Osthafenplatz, Schillerplatz and Bockenheim switching stations, and a further cable connects to the Griesheim hydro station. There are 100 kV. double circuit lines which link the station via Wölfersheim to Borken, and to Dörnigheim,
      thus linking up via Dettingen and Aschaffenburg with the Bayernwerk grid and via Kelsterbach with the 220 kV. grid of the R.W.E. Kelsterbach 5 miles S.W. of Frankfort (2) This large sub-station is situated in wooded country, approximately 5 miles
      S.W. of Frankfort. It is a focal point in the high-voltage transmission system, lines diverging northwards to feed into each end of the Ruhr industrial area, and southward to collect surplus output from the water-power stations on the river Rhine
      and in the mountainous districts of Bavaria and Austria. The sub-station has two 380/220 kV. double-circuit lines to Koblenz and Rheinau respectively, one 220 kV. line, believed to be a double-circuit line, to Kreuztal, and four 110 kV. lines to
      Aschaffenburg, Erzhausen, Wölfersheim, and Höchst/Main. The plant has two 48 MW. transformers for 220/110 kV, 2 sets of three single-phase reactors, and three Petersen coils.

      Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke A.G. (Heddernheimer Kupferwerke) Heddernheim (1+) This target is the airscrew, aircraft components and non-ferrous metal works of the Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke A.G. (V.D.M.) (Heddernheimer Kupferwerke) situated
      about 1/2 mile North of Heddernheim, a suburb of Frankfort/Main and about 4 miles North by West of the centre of that city. It occupies a triangular area of about 600 acres on the West side of the marshy ground which here forms a broad belt to the West
      of the river Nidda. This works has been considerably expanded in recent years, particularly since 1939, and the total number of workers employed is now thought to be not far short of 10,000. The V.D.M. was originally engaged mainly in the production and
      fabrication of copper and copper alloys and produced sheets, strips, rods, sections, castings, stampings, extensions, tubes and wire in copper, bronze, brass, copper-nickel etc. These products included many specialities such as locomotive boiler tubes, condenser
      tubes, vessels for chemical plant, welding electrodes, bearing alloys, detonators etc. and also fine copper wire for use in electrical apparatus.
      <pb n="233" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454373"/>
      Owing to its great experience in the working of non-ferrous metals it was inevitable that when the light alloy industry began to be developed V.D.M. should play a leading part in it. Products In addition to its production of copper and copper-alloy
      semi-products Heddernheim is believed to be producing a large range of semi-products in light alloys for use by aircraft manufacturers and other armament manufacturers and an important range of specialized aircraft components. The semi-products
      include sheet and strip, tubes, pressings and stampings, extruded sections, and castings. The special aircraft components are known to include airscrew hubs and all metal variable pitch airscrews, retractable undercarriages and oleo legs, wheels,
      shock-absorber devices and control gear. Examples of V.D.M. products in military equipment are also known, and the company is almost certainly also making light-metal fittings for submarines. Capacity An up-to-date estimate for the capacity of the
      Heddernheim works is difficult to produce, especially owing to the difficulty of estimating the extent to which copper-fabricating plant in this and other works has been turned over to working on light alloys. It is known that Heddernheim had one of
      the best rolling mills in Germany for aluminium sheet and strip and produced about 6,000 tons per year which was about 10% of the country's total former output. Heddernheim's capacity for the production of extruded sections is believed to have been
      about 4,000 tons per year or about 25% of the total German capacity. At least 50% of the total output was required by the aircraft industry. It is also (after I.G. Bitterfeld) one of the two most important producers of wrought magnesium-alloy
      products. The output of complete airscrews at Heddernheim at the present time is believed to be slightly above 30% of the total German production.

      Friedrichshafen is on the Northern shore of Lake Constance at the junction of the railway lines from Lindau and from Ulm which run together westwards from Friedrichshafen to Basle. It is a railway centre of some importance. Industrially Friedrichshafen
      is probably the most important town of its size in Germany. It is the seat of four very large engineering works; the Dornier Werke G.m.b.H., Maybach Motorenbau G.m.b.H., Luftschiffbau Zeppelin G.m.b.H., and the Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen A.G. These

      Dornier Werke G.m.b.H. Loewenthal and Allmansweiler (2) The Allmansweiler-Löwenthal plant has been devoted to final assembly, special installations, tests, and possibly repairs of Do. 217s. In August 1943, according to a well-informed source, this
      unit was the centre for the development of specialised Dornier types such as the Do. 217M, equipped with DB. 603 engines, and a high altitude reconnaissance type. At that time it was assembling 20 Do. 217s per month. Since then all
      <pb n="249" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454389"/>
      evidence points to decreased activity and recent cover of the field shows only 20 to 25 aircraft, including a number of modified types and experimental models. It is doubtful if new Do. 217s are being produced here at present, though repairs and
      the installation of special equipment may be continuing on a small scale. Interest in this plant as a target derives mainly from (1) reports that the Dornier organization and this unit in particular are tooling up for production of F.W. 190s, (2)
      reports that certain Dornier plants in the Friedrichshafen area are engaged in production of the Peenemünde 20, and (3) the possibility that this plant may resume production of Do. 217 fighters in an effort to make up losses in twin-engine fighters
      resulting from recent attacks on German aircraft factories and operating attrition of the GAF. Dornier Werke G.m.b.H. Manzell (2) This plant is the parent works of the Dornier complex at Friedrichshafen. A year ago it was engaged in experimentation
      and development of new Dornier types, the production of Do 217 components for assembly at Allmansweiler/Löwenthal, and possibly some seaplane development and assembly. The nature and scale of the plant's activities at present can only be inferred
      from the accumulation of existing ground reports. This intelligence is summarized below: i) There is no evidence that seaplanes are being assembled, though the plant probably serves as a seaplane base and may continue to do experimental work on
      Dornier seaplanes. ii) Manufacture of Do 217 components may be continuing on a reduced scale. The total output of Do 217s in all three complexes is not believed at present to exceed 20 per month.
      <pb n="250" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454390"/>
      iii) With other plants in the Friedrichshafen district, Dorner at Manzell may contribute in some way to the production of pilotless aircraft. Intelligence is not conclusive on this point but points strongly to some type of involvement. iv) This
      plant may be tooling up for the manufacture of FW 190 components since it is reported that Dornier is to undertake production of this aircraft and Friedrichshafen has been specifically mentioned.

      Maybach Motorenbau G.m.b.H. Friedrichshafen (1) While the Maybach plant has been variously reported producing ball bearings, aero-engines, gears, gear boxes, and a multiplicity of other articles, its primary importance lies in the tank engine
      field. Virtually all German tank engines are Maybach designed and available evidence renders it probable that upward of 60 per cent. of all German tank engines pass through the Friedrichshafen works. The plant also produces about one third of
      Germany's engines for semi-tracked vehicles. Engine repair facilities of considerable size and importance are also contained within the Friedrichshafen plant. Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen A.G. Friedrichshafen (1) Ground reports and other sources of
      intelligence justify classifying the Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen as Germany's leading gear and gear-box makers. The relative importance of the firm's several plants is difficult to assess but it may be safely said that the Friedrichshafen branch is
      one of the leading German gear makers, making its greatest contribution to the A.F.V. field, but being important also in the manufacture of aircraft reduction gear, truck steering gears, etc.

      Luftschiffbau Zeppelin G.m.b.H. Friedrichshafen (1) The full range of products turned out by these large works is not known but it may safely be assumed that its principal activities are a) the manufacture of gear boxes (and possibly also gears)
      which are made in association with the aforementioned Zahnradfabrik: b) the assembly and erection of RADAR equipment probably in association with Telefunken of Berlin. It is possible that the Luftschiffbau also undertake the manufacture of light
      metal components (castings and pressings) for radiolocation ground equipment and other purposes.

      Goslar is situated at the foot of the northern edge of mountains, 25 miles south of Brunswick, on the rich ore deposits of the Harz district. In the vicinity are smelters producing lead, zinc and copper. In the year 1937 the district contributed 41%
      of the total German lead production. The chief producer of lead in the district is the Rammelsberg mine, situated 2 miles south of Goslar, which, when working at full pressure, yields an output of lead concentrates amounting to about 30% of
      Germany's total production; the copper output of this mine, though principally a producer of lead and zinc, is also considerable. The mining company owning the mine, the Unterharzer Berg- u. Hüttenwerke, is a subsidiary of the Preussische Bergwerks-
      u. Hütten A.G. which company operates other metal mines in Klausthal and Lautenthal through subsidiary undertakings. The mines are scatterd among the hills, at Harlingerode to the East, Rammelsberg to the South, and at Klausthal and Lautenthal to the

      Halle is a railway centre of great importance. It is on the main line from Berlin to Frankfort/Main and together with Leipzig which is 20 miles to the S.E. it forms the focal point of the railway system of industrial Saxony. Apart from the railway
      workshops and the aeroplane factory described below, the industry of Halle is mostly in the hands of small firms and includes engineering works, metal foundries, printing and furniture making. To the North and South of the town are large brown-coal
      deposits and the firms exploiting these have their head offices in Halle. Halle is a compact and densely populated town. A large proportion of the population work in or in connection with the outlying districts. There are two highly important works,
      within 10 miles of and to the South of Halle: the Leuna works at Merseburg and the Buna works at Schkopau. At Teutschenthal 10 miles to the West there is a notable non-ferrous metal works. All these are dealt with under their separate headings. The
      small suburb of Ammendorf, 1 mile to the South of Halle, is not inside the administrative area, and is dealt with separately.

      Hamburg has, for a considerable time, held the first place among the ports of Continental Europe, and has risen to be the third largest shipping centre in the world. This development is due not only to the vast extensions and the modernisations of
      its Free Port, but also to the exceptional facilities offered for storing and manipulating goods in bond - notably colonial produce and oil. Hamburg's sea-going merchant fleet counted, on January 1st 1937, 1,538 ships, with an aggregate of
      2,275,000 G.R.T. During 1938, the port's incoming and outgoing traffic each amounted to 20 1/2 million tons net, while imports of goods reached 18 million tons, and exports 7 1/4 million tons. The old port was confined to the northern side of the River
      Elbe, but the really important and modern port has developed entirely along the river's southern bank. This main port area falls roughly into two sections (a) centred on the HANSA-HAFEN and (b) on the ODER-HAFEN, which provide accommodation for
      the chief overseas liners. In the new port too are the big shipbuilding yards, and numerous engineering and armament works. Besides plants connected with shipbuilding, the port area accommodates other big engineering works and roughly half of
      Hamburg's very important oil-storage installations (total pre-war capacity over 1,300,000 tons), oil-crushing mills, non-ferrous metal works, several aircraft and aircraft component factories including important airscrew works, as well as grain,
      and other foodstuff factories and storage centres. Next in importance to the port proper comes the Harburg-Wilhelmsburg district, to the South, where big vegetable-oil plants, other food processing factories, the huge grain and produce warehouses,
      chemical works and a well-known rubber tyre factory are located. Altona, on the northern bank of the Elbe, specialises more in light metal industries, including castings for aero-engines, but has also several other important industries and food
      storage installations. In the inner port (Binnenhafen-Sandtorhafen), also on the Altona side of the port, lies the very congested chief warehouse area. A net of railway tracks connects this area with the Main Station of Hamburg.
      <pb n="304" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454444"/>
      One of the striking features of the central residential and commercial area of the city proper is the Alster Lake (actually a widened arm of the River Elbe). The major (northern) portion of this lake is known as the Aussen-Alster (outer Alster), and
      the much smaller and narrower southern tip is called the Binnen-Alster (inner Alster). Crossing this portion is the Lombard bridge, which forms (or formed) the sole connecting link between the business district of the city and the large residential
      district to the West. The whole of the Binnen-Alster is now camouflaged. Apart from the industries and warehouses located in the port area, Altona, and Harburg-Wilhelmsburg, there are numerous works, storage installations, etc. scattered about other
      districts of greater Hamburg. The railway system includes nine major complexes of goods stations, marshalling yards, and sidings. Of these, five are situated in, or adjacent to, the port area. A sixth lies to the South of the Süder-Elbe (outside
      the port proper) stretching for about 7 km., roughly North to South, along the southern outskirts of Harburg, between the Gutmoor and the Wilstorf-Ronneburg district. The remaining three goods yards etc. are in the Altona, Stellingen, and Barmbeck
      areas. All are connected with the Hamburg Central Station. At the end of 1936 the railway-net measured 138 km., the tramway system 232 km.

      the docks area to the East of the town where the Elbe-Bille and the Moorflether canals join the Holzhafen. Built in 1915, it has recently been extended by the addition of very high-pressure boilers and super-imposed turbines. The station supplies
      steam to a district heating system mainly for the surrounding area of Bille. It has an installed capacity of 129 MW. There are no long-distance supplies but there is a substation for 25 kV and 30 kV 3-phase A.C. and also for D.C. Supplies are given
      to the tramway system, to parts of the inner towns, to the elevated railways, and the local State railways. There are 25 kV underground cables connecting to Bille, Barmbeck, and Carolinenstrasse; and 30 kV lines connecting to Bergedorf and to
      Lübeck via Bargeteheide. The station is also connected to the Neuhof generating station. Elektrizitätswerke Neuhof (2) This thermal power station, also owned by the Hamburgische Elektricitäts-Werke A.G. is the second main power station supplying
      the city of Hamburg. It is situated in the Neuhofer Canal adjacent to the railway sidings south of the Oderhafen. It has an installed capacity of 130 MW. The station was opened in 1926 and was designed to have an ultimate capacity of 300 MW. The last
      known extension was in 1931 and brought the capacity of the station to 130 MW. It is thought probable that some further increase in capacity has been made since that date. A transformer and switching house is attached to the machine house. The
      station is connected to the Hamburg city supply network and the other local generating stations by medium- and low-voltage cables. So far as is known, no high voltage overhead lines are connected.

      Norddeutsche Affinerie Peute (1) This is the most important copper smelting and refining unit in Germany. Its smelting and blast furnaces treat imported ores, matte, and concentrates, as well as imported scrap. The refineries treat blister copper and
      imported high-grade scrap. In 1938, the plant had an estimated capacity for electrolytic refining of 90,000 tons per annum and a capacity for fire refining of 30,000 tons per annum. Before the war, an appreciable quantity of nickel was recovered
      from fire-refined and electrolytic copper produced by other German refineries and, by means of the process of recovery employed at Norddeutsche Affinerie, some 350 tons of metallic nickel were produced annually before 1938 from these sources. This
      refinery was also engaged in recovering metal from the increased nickel coinage minted in 1933 when the coinage was recalled in 1939. Since there is no great reservoir of nickel scrap to be drawn upon in Germany, it is probable that present
      production of recovered nickel amounts to only 50% of capacity, which is estimated at 500 tons of metal per annum. Some nickel may also be produced direct from Petsamo ores, in a small smelter which formerly treated Moroccan nickel-cobalt ores. These
      works also include a lead refining plant which had an annual capacity of 36,000 tons before the war. Other installations are a small cobalt refinery and sulphuric acid plant. The latter is estimated to have had a capacity of 40,000 tons per annum in

      re-running plant, but there is no firm evidence that it is active. Its prewar capacity was 10,000 tons per annum and there are storage facilities of 50,000 tons capacity. Mineraloel and Asphaltwerke A.G. (M.A.W.A.G.) Ostermoor (-) This plant, which,
      prior to the war, operated mainly for asphalt, is believed to be inactive. Its prewar capacity was 150,000 tons p.a. Note: Prior to the war Hamburg was of great importance as an oil-storage centre. The principal concentration of storage facilities
      are installed at the Oelhafen. Hamburg's total storage facilities amounted to 1,600,000 tons, which figure includes the storage capacities mentioned under the individual refineries listed above. It is not known to what extent any of the storage
      facilities in the Hamburg area are being utilized and there is reason to believe that many of the storage plants not directly connected with the refineries are inactive.

      Hamm is one of the most vital centres for the railway traffic to the Ruhr. It forms a railway entrance from central and eastern Germany to the whole vast network of the Ruhr railway system. The chief activities of the town itself are concerned with
      the railway, but there are a number of wire and engineering works and a varnish factory, none of which is individually of importance. Hamm is also the centre of a group of important coal mines which feed the long-distance gas-supply system and a
      number of power plants, one of which is of great importance. These have been included in the list below.

      Marshalling Yards Hamm (1) These are the largest and best-equipped marshalling yards in Germany. In 1939 their capacity was 10,000 wagons in 24 hours. The greater part of the rail traffic to and from the heart of the Ruhr and Lower Rhine, Wuppertal,
      Lennetal, and Köln districts passes through these yards and is here sorted for the numerous lines serving these most highly industrialised districts of Germany or for despatch to all other parts of the country, except the southern Provinces, and the
      extreme N.W. corner. It is a vital nerve centre of the German railway system. Railway Junction Hamm (2) Hamm is not only the marshalling centre for the goods traffic but is also an important junction for all passenger trains proceeding between
      Western Germany and Northern and Eastern Germany. Two main lines from the East

      Hanover is on the trunk railway line from Berlin to the Rhineland, Ruhr, Holland, Belgium and Northern France. It is a junction for an important branch leading from Central Germany, and has direct rail connections with Hamburg and Bremen. The
      Mittelland Kanal, one of the principal arteries of the North German waterways system, passes through the Northern outskirts of the town. Hanover, which was formerly the capital of the Kingdom of Hanover, is a highly industrialised city and one of the
      chief commercial and administrative centres of Northern Germany. The main industries are engineering, rubber tyres, and armaments. The Continental rubber works are estimated to supply 80 per cent of Germany's aero tyre requirements, and the Hanomag
      factories are of outstanding importance in the manufacture of A.F.V.'s, gun carriages, tractors, and military transport. There are a number of other large-scale industrial works, the products of which include wire and cables, A.A. and field guns,
      non-ferrous metal fabrication, accumulators, chemicals, and textiles. The industries are mainly grouped to the North West and West of the town. The area that extends from Brink (North of Hanover) Westwards along the Mittelland Kanal to Nordhafen and
      Stöcken has been selected for the development of several of Germany's new armaments plants. The Hackethal cable works, a large new accumulator factory, and new works of Continental and Hanomag, are included in this area. To the West of Hanover, in
      the suburbs of Leinhausen and Linden, are the parent works of Continental and Hanomag, and a number of other engineering works which are described below. In Misburg, and outlying suburb three miles to the East of the city centre, is an important oil
      refinery, which has been built on the Western edge of an extensive oil field. Misburg has also been selected as the site for a recently-constructed ordnance factory. A small coalfield lies in the region of Barsinghausen, 8 miles to the South West of

    <Engineering_and_Armaments>Carl Zeiss Carl Zeiss Str. (1) The works of this world-famous concern are in the centre of the town and are housed in a group of buildings several storeys high including one skyscraper building of 17 storeys. Several
      thousand workers are employed. The great majority of the work requires a high degree of specialised skill and there is an elaborate system of training schools for apprentices. It is believed that no foreign labour is employed in Jena and because of
      the nature of the work, there is a probably unique concentration of highly skilled labour in this town. Zeiss have now three and possibly four large associated factories in Dresden, (Zeiss Ikon Werke A.G.) and branch factories are known to have been
      established in Hirschberg and Gorlitz in Silesia. Zeiss controlled affiliated companies are at Stuttgart, Berlin, Rathenow and Vienna. Jena remains, however, the chief training centre for the concern and is by far the largest of the Zeiss works. It
      turns out the whole range of precision optical instruments required by the armed forces. These instruments are made in their entirety by the Zeiss works, of which one section is devoted to the casting, grinding and polishing of the lenses, while
      another section deals with the complete manufacture of the precision metal parts of the instruments. The apprentice schools mentioned above, train workers for each of these two sections of the industry. It is worth noting that the Zeiss works at Jena
      are not an ordinary commercial concern, but since 1891 have been in the hands of a trust. The profits belong to the workers on a co-partnership basis and to the Jena University. It is believed that the Jena Works of Zeiss alone employ some 12,000
      workers. The Zeiss company have their own private power station in Jena; it is believed to have a capacity of 24 MW. (See under "Public Utilities"). Schott and Genossen Otto Schott Str. (1) The Jenaer Glaswerke Schott and Genossen is
      situated in the Southern part of the town close to the West-Bahnhof. These large works were taken over in 1919 by the Carl Zeiss Trust and can be regarded as a second factory of the Zeiss concern in Jena.

      Although Karlsruhe is the capital and the administrative centre of Baden, industrially it is by no means as important as Mannheim, the largest city in the province. Situated on the main line from Western Germany to Italy via Switzerland, Karlsruhe is
      today of considerable importance as a transport centre. It is on this route that the bulk of coal supplies from the Ruhr to Italy is transported. Karlsruhe is also of some importance for waterway's traffic as its fairly modern harbour, connected with
      the Rhine by the Stich Canal, has extensive installations for reloading coal. Industrially Karlsruhe is not of great importance. Its main industry is engineering connected with armaments and it is situated mainly in the Eastern and Western outskirts
      of the town. There are two main target areas:- "A" The inland port connected with the Rhine by the Stich Canal and the industrial area Grunwinkel, between which the town's power station is situated. (An important sector of the railway passes through
      this industrial area). "B". To the East of the main railway station, the marshalling yard, large railway workshops and the town gas works. Adjacent to the gas works is the important junction of the railway lines to Frankfort on Main and Stuttgart. In
      the centre of the built-up area of Karlsruhe, between Vorholz Strasse and Garten Strasse is the important small arms ammunition works of the former Deutsche Waffen and Munitionsfabriken A.G. Because of the unfavourable situation of Karlsruhe close
      to the French frontier this works was partly closed down during the early stages of the war but is now believed to be working again at full capacity employing several thousand workers.

      Inland Harbour Karlsruhe (2) Karlsruhe is an important trans-shipment centre for the Rhine traffic, the chief commodities being coal and timber. The inland harbour, which has five basins, is entered from the Rhine through the Stichkanal which is one
      mile in length. The harbour area was severely damaged by the R.A.F. and lost much of its storage capacity and other facilities. A considerable amount of repair work has been carried out and the port is now again an important trans-shipment centre.
      Railway junction Karlsruhe (2) The main line to Basle which passes through Karlsruhe is one of the chief trunk routes from Germany to Switzerland and Italy. A second main line leads Eastwards from Karlsruhe through Pforzheim to Stuttgart and
      Southern Germany. Five miles from Karlsruhe a branch diverges from this second main line and leads North East to Bruchsal and Heidelberg. A further branch to the West crosses the Rhine one mile North of the Stichkanal and joins the railway

      continually enlarged during the first years of the war and with the adoption of standard locomotive types their capacity increased to many times the above figure. One of the most important manufacturers of trucks in Germany before the war, this firm
      was also of great importance in supplying German requirements for heavy transport vehicles, which were largely used with trailers. Truck production was of relatively small importance in relation to the activities of this firm in other branches of
      engineering, although in connection with heavy road transport it was an important contribution to the German requirements. Their manufactures include municipal-type vehicles, such as road sweeping, washing and sprinkling machines, and refuse
      collecting vehicles; and also the "Finkbeiner" producer-gas unit which is one of the 12 types standardised by Germany. It is belived that even before the war at least one section of the parent works (Werk I) was engaged on the design and construction
      of medium and heavy tank prototypes and it is probable that during the war certain serial production of tanks took place at the Henschel works in co-operation with Wegmann and Co. (see below). Henschel Henschelstr. (1) Werk I. The parent factory of

      Kehl is a frontier town on the right bank of the river Rhine. It is connected to Strassburg (France) by rail and road bridges over the river. Industrially Kehl is of no particular importance but its state owned harbour, which has been considerably
      extended during the past six years, is important. In this area the prevailing traffic is in transit goods from and to France. Kehl was built in 1896 to compete with Strassburg harbours. In 1938 the total turnover of traffic in Kehl was 1,995,000 tons. In
      the pre-war period Strassburg handled a greater volume of traffic than any other inland port of France. Rhine traffic at Strassburg harbour 1929-1937 increased from 4.8 million tons to 5.4 million
      <pb n="386" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454526"/>
      tons and canal traffic for the same period increased from 1.6 to 2.4 million tons. The harbour installations of Kehl consist of three basins 3,500 m., 1,700 m. and 505 m. long respectively, having an average width of 80 m. There are electric cranes,
      loading bridges, numerous coal dressing plants and extensive storage yards. Over half the inward traffic is from the Lower Rhine and outward traffic is scarcely 1/3 of the inward. Commodities exported are wood, grain, potash, soda, clay, lignite and
      chemicals. Goods coming from France are potash, iron ore, basic slag, soda, salt, grain, bran and finished products such as shaped iron, chemicals and large quantities of coal via the Saar Canal and Rhine-Main Canal.

      Kiel, the capital of Schleswig Holstein, is situated at the Southern end of the Kieler Förde (Hafen). This bay, about 11 miles long and a quarter to 4 1/2 miles broad, is considered one of the best havens in Europe. On its Western side is the mouth of
      the famous Kaiser Wilhelm (or Kiel) Canal, and on the Eastern side, the mouth of the river Schwentiene. Kiel is the principal base of the German Navy and in all respects entirely a naval town, with dockyards, victualling and fuel stores, shipbuilding,
      engineering and armaments works. The harbour provides anchorage for a large fleet and quick access to the North Sea through the Kiel Canal, which joins the river Elbe at Brunsbüttelkog. Thanks to the canal, Kiel is also safely connected by water
      with Hamburg, Emden and the Dutch ports. The Canal's total length from Kiel (Holtenau) to Brunsbüttelkog on the Elbe is 53 nautical miles and its depth 37,07 feet. The double lock gates of the Canal are at its Eastern (Holtenau) end and so are the two
      Easternmost bridges over the Canal, the Levensau bridge and the Prinz Heinrich bridge. Both bridges carry roads, and the local railway line between Kiel and Flensburg passes over the Levensau bridge. There are two principal target areas in Kiel:-
      a) Stretching from Gaarden to Mönckeberg along the Eastern side of the Kieler Hafen. In this area are the three great shipbuilding yards, the big underground oil-storage plant and ammunition stores, and, in the centre of the area, the largest Naval
      arsenal in Germany. Of outstanding importance is the construction of U-boats in this area. b) Immediately at and partly to the West of the Mouth of the Kiel Canal, in the Holtenau-Wick district is a group of less important targets. These targets consist
      of the Canal lock gates and bridges, the power station, oil-storage depots, and some Naval equipment works. A third series of outlying targets includes a plant producing thin shell and air leads, as well as assembling torpedoes, and other
      plants manufacturing torpedo components, aeronautical instruments, signalling apparatus, and light-metal products. Fifteen miles Northwest of Kiel at Eckenförde there is believed to be a new and important torpedo factory.

      Cologne is the centre of trade, traffic, and political activity in the Rhine Province. Although it possesses important industrial establishments, its chief significance lies in its situation at the crossing of a number of trade routes. It is the main
      railway-centre in the Rhineland, and a very important inland port. The geographical position of Cologne has been the chief factor in determining the nature of its industry. Its proximity to the Ruhr coalfields and its rail, road, and river transport
      facilities have caused the growth of firms specialising in light and heavy engineering, chemicals, building, and textiles; in peace-time Cologne was also noted for its luxury products, including chocolate and perfumery. Since 1939 there has been
      an expansion of certain engineering works and other factories engaged on war production. These are concentrated mainly in Ehrenfeld, Kalk, and Mülheim to the East of the city on the right bank of the Rhine. Other industrial districts with a fair
      number of important war factories are Sülz, Bayenthal, Poll, Deutz, Nippes, Riehl, and Niehl. Further important industrial concerns are to be found in the outlying districts of Heumar, Porz, Rondorf, Hürth, Kalscheuren, Knapsack-Goldenberg,
      Berrenrath, and Brauweiler. The built-up area of Cologne itself is of no importance from a purely industrial point of view, as it is composed mainly of residential areas with the appropriate shops, offices, and wholesale houses. The population figure
      of 912,000 includes the outlying townships mentioned above.

    <Public_Utility_Services>Kraftwerk Knapsack-Goldenberg Hürth (5 miles South-West of Köln) (1+) This complex, owned by R.W.E., consists of six generating stations, four briquette works, and a chemical works. The generating plant comprises
      the:- Goldenberg power-station 530 MW capacity Knapsack I power-station 70 MW capacity Knapsack II power-station 50 MW capacity Knapsack III power-station 75 MW capacity Knapsack IV power-station 75 MW capacity Knapsack V power-station 20 MW capacity
      The complex covers an area of about one-third of a square mile and is the largest concentration of thermal generating plant in Germany, having a total capacity of 820 MW. Brown coal is obtained from the neighbouring mines "Vereinigte Ville" and Berrenrath.
      Adjacent to the mines is a carbide plant which in 1936 had a capacity of 50,000 tons per annum. R.W.E. Transformer Station Brauweiler (1+) Covering an area of about 100 acres, this is the largest installation of its kind in Europe, and probably the largest
      sub-station in the world. There are 3 bus-bar systems for 220 kV and 5 for 110 kV. The main switching control of the turbo-generator sets at the Goldenberg generating station is carried out here, and the buildings contain a special generator set for line-testing
      as well as what was, before the war, the main control room of the R.W.E. There are 4 interbus transformers for 220/110 kV, one of which has a capacity of 80 MW., while the other three have individual capacities of 48 MW. The plant also includes smaller transformers
      for local supply. The station is connected to Koblenz by a double circuit 380/220 kV line, and to Knapsack, Herdecke, Wesel, and possibly Fortuna by 220 kV lines. 110 kV lines run to Knapsack, Osterrath, Wesel, Funlingen, Kuppersteg, Erftwerk and probably to Fortuna.
      The station therefore controls upwards of 1 1/2 million kW, a high proportion of the power consumption of the Ruhr. Information received states that connection has been established with the Liège-Bressoux power-station and thereby with the Belgian Grid.

    <Description>
      Konstanz is at the Western end of Lake Constance at the point where the Rhine flows out of the lake. The town's railway connection with Germany consists of a branch line from Singen which at Konstanz joins the Swiss railway along the Southern shore
      of the lake. To the North Konstanz is cut off from the German shore by the North-western arm of the lake. The town extends into Switzerland and the frontier passes through the Southern suburbs. It is a health resort. The industries, which include
      book printing, textile fancy goods, and a few small chemical works, are unimportant, except for the works listed below.

      H.I.A.G. Konstanz (3) Known by the name of Holzverkohlungs-Industrie A.G. (H.I.A.G.) this is a subsidiary undertaking of the Deutsche Gold- und Silberscheideanstalt. Before the amalgamation in 1926 H.I.A.G. headquarters were in Konstanz together with
      the research laboratories. Before the war the works were known to be engaged on producing chemicals based on ethyl alcohol as the raw material: this is presumed to have now ceased. Wood distillation was once carried out on a considerable scale but,
      in view of the present unimportance of this product, production of it may have ceased. This remains, however, an important centre for developing chemical processes.</Chemicals_and_Explosives>

      Kosel is on the right bank of the Oder 25 miles West of Gleiwitz. It is a railway junction of importance to the coal mining and heavy industries of Upper Silesia. There is a large inland harbour serving the waterborne coal traffic from Upper
      Silesia which is here loaded on to the Oder barges. The Klodnitz Canal (now renamed Adolf Hitler Canal), which was nearing completion in 1939, leaves the Oder at Kosel and leads to Gleiwitz where an extensive coal trans-shipment port has been
      constructed. This canal has probably reduced the importance of Kosel as regards coal trans-shipment but on the other hand Kosel has acquired additional value as an inland port owing to its proximity to the synthetic-oil plants at Blechhammer and
      Deschowitz.
    </Description>
    <Transportation>
      Inland Harbour Kosel (2) The inland harbour is to the North of the town and consists of three docks entered from a basin cut out of the Eastern bank of the Oder. The docks are served by an extensive system of railway sidings and are capable of
      handling 3 1/2 million tons per annum, 95% of which in peacetime was coal. The Klodnitz canal leaves the Oder immediately to the South of the dock area. A pipeline connects the Schaffgottsch'sche synthetic-oil plant at Deschowitz with the inland
      harbour of Kosel. Deschowitz is six miles to the North. Blechhammer, where there are 2 large synthetic oil plants, is six miles East of Kosel and is situated on the Klodnitz Canal.

      Krefeld lies on the west of the Rhine, some 15 miles N.W. of Düsseldorf, and is one of the most important railway junctions in Western Germany. In addition to numerous secondary lines, four main lines meet at Krefeld, namely from Holland in the N.W.,
      Belgium in the S.W., Düsseldorf in the S.E., and the Ruhr in the N.E. Silk manufacture, of which Krefeld was the centre before the war, is now of secondary importance since the development of the Deutsche Edelstahlwerke A.G. which specialises in the
      production of special steel particularly for the aircraft industry. There are also several light engineering works. Krefeld has been heavily damaged by bombing. The damage is concentrated in the centre of the town and in the area surrounding the Adolf
      Hitler Strasse and the West Wall. The nearby town of Uerdingen is described under its own heading.

      Kruppamühle is in Upper Silesia 30 miles East of Oppeln and near to the railway station of Keilerswalde on a branch railway leading from Oppeln to Tarnowitz (in Poland) and within 3 miles of the former Polish frontier. Apart from the explosives
      factory mentioned below there is no industrial development but the pre-war population will now have been largely increased presumably by the erection of workers' camps.
    </Description>
    <Chemicals_and_Explosives>
      Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H. Kruppamühle (2) This factory is operated by the Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H., but, owing to its inaccessible situation in Upper Silesia, there is very little up-to-date information regarding its activities.
      <pb n="420" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454561"/>
      The factory covers a large area and is believed to be well equipped; but, owing to its bad strategic situation in close proximity to the former Polish frontier, it does not appear to have been much used for military purposes until some time after the
      invasion of Poland. Ground reports since that date suggest that the factory has now become of great importance, and although there is no air reconnaissance to confirm this, the reports must be considered of substance in view of the strategic
      situation of the plant, which is now as favourable as it was at one time dangerous. It has been reported that the factory manufactures hexanitrodiphenylamine, tetryl and T.N.T., and that it has its own nitric-acid plant. It has also been reported
      that the factory makes nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose. It is not common practice to manufacture high explosives and propellant explosives in the same plant, but since the Kruppamühle factory was used for many years for the production of mining
      explosives, it probably has a nitroglycerine plant, and for this reason a propellants section may have been developed.</Chemicals_and_Explosives>
