      Leipzig is the largest town in Saxony. It is highly industrialised, particularly in textiles and engineering. Prior to the war the famous Leipzig Trade Fair drew a large conmercial public from all parts of the world. Leipzig's main railway station is
      the largest in Europe. The Supreme Courts of Law of the Reich are established in the city and Leipzig is also the centre of the German publishing industry. Railway lines radiate from the city in all directions, and there are extensive marshalling yards
      which form an inportant base for the traffic to the Eastern Front. Leipzig's industries have been developed chiefly on the outskirts of the town and can be divided into two main groups. The first extends from the main station to the North East and
      South of the city. This area contains several important engineering plants, spinning and weaving mills, and the Northern power station. The second industrial group is on the Western outskirts.This district includes some of the largest wool and cotton
      spinning mills in Europe and a number of big engineering works. During the war important aircraft assembly plants have been established on the airfield at Mochau on the North-eastern edge of the town area. The city also contains a number of chemical
      works, mostly engaged on the manufacture of soap and dyestuffs.
    </Description>
    <Transportation>Railway Centre Leipzig (2) This terminal station, which is the largest building of its kind in Europe, is an important centre serving many parts of Germany and the Continent. In particular there are lines leading from Leipzig to
      Berlin, Breslau, Dresden Frankfort, Halle, and Southern Germany. The area includes marshalling yards, postal sidings and storage depots.
      <pb n="429" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454588"/>
      Marshalling Yards Paunsdorf (3) These marshalling yards, which are situated in the Eastern suburb of Paunsdorf, can handle up to 3,500 wagons per 24 hours. Marshalling Yards Wahren (3) These yards are in the North-western suburb of Wahren. They have a
      capacity of 4,500 wagons per 24 hours. Railway Repair Shops Delitzsch (3) At Delitzsch, 10 miles North of Leipzig, there are railway workshops formerly employing some 1,200 workers and undertaking chiefly the repair of goods wagons. Power Station
      Böhlen (1) This very large thermal power station is owned by the A.G. Sächsische Werke (ASW) and has an installed capacity of 393 MW. It is situated on the brown-coal deposits at Böhlen, 11 miles S. of Leipzig, and is part of a large industrial
      complex which includes, besides the power station, a synthetic-oil plant (described below under Liquid Fuels), a low temperature carbonisation plant, (described below under Solid Fuels), and a gas-works (described below). The station is operated on base
      load and supplies current to the grid system and the city of Leipzig and is also the source of power to the synthetic-oil plant, whose estimated maximum demand is 75 MW with an annual consumption of over 500 million kWh. Five long-distance
      double-circuit 110 kV lines run to Chemnitz, Gossnitz, Zeitz, Lausen, and Leipzig respectively and another probably connects with the neighbouring double station of Espenhain-Molbis. Local 30 kV supplies connect to Leipzig by underground cables and
      at lower voltages to neighbouring industrial works. Gasworks Böhlen (3) The gas works is part of the ASW complex at Böhlen and was erected in 1939 by the Company for the supply of domestic gas to Leipzig and the surrounding district. It operates the
      Luigi complete-gasification process, using brown coal. Capacity is belived to be about 5,000 million cu.ft. per annum.
      <pb n="430" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454589"/>
      Power Station Espenhain-Mölbis (1) This large power station belongs to the ASW and has an installed capacity of 297 MW. It is situated between the villages of Espenhain and Mölbis, on the brown-coal fields about 5 miles East of the Böhlen station,
      and forms part of an industrial complex which includes a low-temperature carbonisation plant and a large new works as yet unidentified. It is a double station with duplicate generating plants 250 yards apart arranged opposite and parallel to each
      other. There is one switching and transformer station common to both sections, and it is assumed that a large part of the electrical output is supplied to the nearby industrial plant, to which steam is also supplied. The station was under construction
      at the beginning of the war and details are therefore incomplete. There are at least 4 long-distance overhead transmission lines, 2 running South-east (possibly one to Dresden and one to Chemnitz), one North-east (possibly to Leipzig), and one West
      (possibly to Böhlen). Power Station Kulkwitz (2) This thermal power station is owned by the Landkraftwerke Leipzig A.G. Kulkwitz, and is situated on the brown coal fields 6 miles South-west of Leipzig. It is an old station, and up to 1938 was only of
      local importance, with an installed capacity of 30 MW. Since that year it has been considerably extended and its capacity increased to 105 MW. It is probable that the station now gives additional supplies to nearby industrial works and to the city of
      Leipzig, and also to the high-voltage grid of the A.G. Sächsische Werke. Städt. Gaswerke Leipzig (2) The municipal gasworks is the principal distributing station on the Thuringian gas grid. It now obtains all its supplies from the Böhlen gasworks
      (see above). In 1936, the works made 1,950 million cu. ft. of gas and purchased for re-sale a further 90 million cu. ft.

      Electric Power Station Leverkusen (2) The thermal power station forms part of the chemical works of the I.G. Farben and has an installed capacity of 100 MW. The station supplies both electricity and steam to the works, which utilise the whole of the
      plant's production. It is not known whether the station is connected to the grid.

      I.G.Farbenindustrie A.G. Leverkusen (1+) The Leverkusen Works of the I.G. concern were formerly known as Friedrich Bayer and Co. and are still frequently referred to as the Bayer Works. The plant, which is responsible for a high proportion of the
      total German production of a number of important chemical products, is of very considerable importance in the German chemical industry.
      <pb n="440" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454599"/>
      One of its main activities is connected with the tableting and ampouling of pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations, serums and associated products. It is by far the largest tableting and ampouling works in Europe, and, apart from finishing
      medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations manufactured at the Leverkusen works, also undertakes the tableting and ampouling of practically the entire output of these products manufactured at Elberfeld, the largest German pharmaceutical plant, and
      Höchst. The heavy-chemical plant at Leverkusen consists primarily of the sulphuric-acid unit, which is estimated to have a capacity of 300,000 tons per year or roughly 11% of the total German capacity. It is the largest German sulphuric-acid unit. The plant
      is also an important producer of electrolytic caustic soda and chlorine. Leverkusen is also one of the largest German factories making dyes and associated products. Among other preparations made here on a large scale are film base, films,
      photographic paper, filters and photographic chemicals. The works includes a synthetic-rubber plant producing "Perdurine" rubber, estimated to have a capacity of 4,000 tons per annum. Several, apparently reliable, reports indicate that toxic acids
      and smoke-producing compounds are prepared at Leverkusen. It is probable that the filling process would be carried out in one of the several filling stations situated within the Cologne area. Situated within the works is the plant of the Titanium
      G.m.b.H., one of the leading German producers of titanium pignents. It is believed that the Leverkusen works employs more than 20,000 people. The works, which extend for over one mile along the river front, occupies the whole area between the river
      and the North-to-South railway along the right bank of the Rhine, which here runs parallel with, and approximately 1,100 yards from, the river. The works has extensive rail sidings, rail storage depots, and large harbour facilities.

      Dynamit A.G. Schlebusch (2) This factory was of considerable importance in the last war. In 1918 it was one of the most important T.N.T. factories in Germany and produced more than 1,000 tons per month. It was one of the few factories permitted to
      continue the manufacture of T.N.T. under the Versailles Treaty and was producing 294 tons monthly in 1923. Both ground reports and air photographs suggest that the factory has returned at least to its full former level of activity, and certain
      extensions appear to have been made. The factory has not only its own nitric-acid plant (as is common practice in large explosives factories), but also its own sulphuric-acid plant using the contact process, which is unusual. It is apparent that
      T.N.T. is still the chief product of the plant, capacity being probably about 15,000 tons per annum. It is clear that other explosives are also made at Schlebusch but it is not certain what these are. It almost certainly has plant for the manufacture
      of nitroglycerine, which may now be used for the production of diglycoldinitrate. In the last war the factory produced a small quantity of hexanitrodiphenyl-sulphide, and although this explosive does not now appear to be used by the German forces the
      plant would be suitable for the manufacture of hexanitrodiphenylamine.</Chemicals_and_Explosives>

      The Baltic port of Lübeck, which has assumed considerable importance as a base for the supply of the Eastern Front and the forces in Norway and Denmark, and is also a submarine building centre, is 30 miles North-east of Hamburg. Lübeck is the terminus of
      the Elbe-Trave Canal which connects with the Elbe and Germany's extensive inland-waterways system, and provides direct communication with Berlin and Hamburg. In recent years Lübeck has grown in importance as an industrial transport and trading centre
      owing to the expansion of the Lübecker Flenderwerke A.G. where submarines and small merchant vessels are built, the construction of a large aircraft-component works, and the enlarging and modernising of the harbour and transport facilities. The
      Elbe-Trave canal joins the River Trave some 2 miles to the South West of Lübeck. The river Trave breaks into several channels which completely enclose the old inner town. It then flows Northwards for a few miles, turns East and enters the sea at
      Travemünde, which contains a seaplane base and is also the terminus of a ferry route to Denmark. The industries lie chiefly to the North and West of the town, the residential areas to the South and East. Included in the town's administrative area is the
      suburb of Schlutup.

      Dynamit A.G. Lunow (3) This factory was apparently under construction at the beginning of the war and has certainly been greatly enlarged since. There is very little ground information concerning its activities, but it appears to be important.
      Unfortunately the only air reconnaissance of the region has provided no more than a photograph of a small corner of the explosives factory in which are some storage sheds. The size of these does not contradict the impression that the factory itself
      is not of considerable size. It is fairly definitely established that penthrite is made in this factory, and it was reported in 1940 that plant for the production of a new explosive for
      <pb n="452" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454611"/>
      torpedoes and bombs had gone into production. The nature of this new explosive is uncertain, but it may be hexanitrodiphenylamine (which is commonly used in German torpedoes and mines), or it may be hexogen. It is significant that the site of
      manufacture of hexogen in Germany has not been positively identified, although this explosive is now used by the German forces. The factory is reported to be opened by Dynamit A.G., but its ownership has not been confirmed. It lies 4 kms. from Luniw

      Magdeburg is the largest town in the Prussian Province of Saxony, and contains heavy and general engineering works of the first order, aero-engine works, an explosives factory, and a large synthetic-oil plant. Its position on the River Elbe and on one
      of the main North to South trade routes of Europe has given it from the earliest times a commercial and industrial importance which it has maintained up to the present day. It is one of the principal traffic centres of Central Germany, and has a railway
      junction which is second only to Berlin itself with lines radiating N. to Hamburg and Rostock, E. to Berlin and the Baltic ports, S.E. to Leipzig and Czechoslovakia, S. to Halle, Nürnberg and Munich, and W. to Hanover and the Ruhr. The central German
      Leipzig-Magdeburg lines have been electrified. The main part of the town is on the left bank of the Elbe, and is a closely built-up area. Industries and groups of industries are situated round most of the town's perimeter. One important group is at
      Neustadt and Rothensee, on the northern outskirts, but the Grusonwerk of Krupps, which occupies the first place in Magdeburg's industries, is in Buckau, the southern portion of the town. There are large marshalling and goods yards both in Rothensee
      and in Buckau. The Western quarter of the town, which is known as the Wilhelmstadt, and the Eastern suburb of Friedrichstadt, which is on the right bank of the Elbe, contain groups of industries. The Elbe divides into two channels, forming an island
      which lies between Magdeburg and Friedrichstadt. This island is itself intersected by a third narrow river channel (the Zoll Elbe)and contains an inland harbour, with warehouses and storage depots. The Mittelland Canal follows an E.-W. course 6 miles
      N. of the town, but this important waterways route is broken where it should be carried over the Elbe, due to the failure to complete the aqueduct, and also by the double ship lift at Hohenwarthe a mile to the east of the aqueduct. Barges therefore have to
      negotiate the 40-60 ft. change in level to the river by the Rothensee shiplift, pass down the N.-S. branch canal into the Elbe, and rejoin the Ihle section of the canal by the locks at Niegripp, a distance of some 8 miles by water from the Rothensee
      shiplift. The town of Schönebeck, 9 miles to the South of Magdeburg, where there are aircraft, ammunition, and chemical factories, is dealt with separately.
    </Description>
    <Transportation>Inland Harbour Magdeburg (2) Magdeburg has extensive inland harbour facilities for the Elbe traffic. The Handelshafen and the Industriehafen, the two largest docks, are at the Northern end of the town close to the industrial areas of
      Neustadt and Rothensee. There are several smaller docks and loading basins further downstream at Rothensee and connected with the Weser-Elbe Canal by the N.-S. branch canal and the Rothensee shiplift. This is part of the Mittelland Kanal system,
      which is continued Eastward from the Elbe to link up with the Oder. There is a further large dock known as the Zollhafen on the island formed by the two arms of the Elbe between Magdeburg and the suburb of Friedrichstadt. Magdeburg handles up to 2
      million tons of waterborne goods per annum, including grain, sugar beet, vegetables, coal and timber.
      <pb n="454" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454613"/>
      The shiplift is situated at the top of the N.-S. branch canal close to its junction with the Mittelland canal; it can lift or lower barges up to 1,000 tons to the maximum of 60 ft. required by the level of the Elbe. Railway Junction Magdeburg (3) The
      main line from Hamburg to Halle and Saxony passes through Magdeburg from North to South. One of the principal routes from Berlin to the Lower Rhineland crosses the Elbe at Rothensee and continues westwards from Magdeburg to Brunswick. Five other
      important branch lines radiate from Magdeburg. The railway junctions are in the Rothensee area and to the South of the main railway station. Marshalling Yard and Repair shops Buckau (2) The Buckau marshalling yard is the most important in Magdeburg,
      and has capacity for handling 3,800 wagons per 24 hours. It extends for 2 miles to the S. of the town. There is a large loco. depot and loco repair shops which are possibly only partly active. Marshalling Yards Rothensee (3) These extensive
      marshalling yards are close to the Industriehafen and to the junction of the lines from Berlin and Hamburg. They have a capacity for 3,000 wagons per 24 hours. Goods Station Magdeburg (3) The main goods station, which includes a number of large
      storage depots, is immediately South of the main railway station in the centre of the town. Railway Repair Shops Salbke (3) These large and well-equipped repair shops are believed to employ some 2,500 workers, and undertake repairs and maintenance of
      all kinds of railway rolling stock. They are in the South Eastern suburb of Salbke, and close to the works of the R. Wolf A.G.

      The twin towns of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen form an industrial centre of great importance, which lies on either side of the Rhine at the confluence of the Rhine and Neckar. Mannheim, which is itself divided by the river Neckar, lies on the Eastern and
      Ludwigshafen on the Western bank of the Rhine. The main railway line up the Rhine valley to Basle passes through Mannheim which is a junction for a branch leading through Heidelberg and the Neckar valley to Heilbronn and Stuttgart. To the West a railway
      crosses the Rhine to Ludwigshafen, Kaiserslautern and the Saar. The harbour area is chiefly concentrated on the right bank of the Rhine immediately North of Mannheim. There are three main industrial areas. The first lies to the North of Ludwigshafen
      and is entirely covered by the huge chemical works of the I.G. Farbenindustrie concern. These works form the largest industrial chemical complex in Germany. Opposite these works and on the right bank of the Alt-Rhine are many engineering
      concerns,including Daimler Benz and Brown Boveri. To the South of the City and in the suburbs of Neckarau and Rheinau are chemical and engineering plants, marshalling yards and an airport. Frankenthal, which is situated some five miles North West of
      Ludwigshafen, is dealt with separately. Inland Port Mannheim (1) The Mannheim port area is divided into two sections which lie on either side of the Neckar in the Northern quarter of Mannheim. The Mühlau-Hafen is between the Rhine and the left bank
      of the Neckar and contains numerous warehouses, loading quays and rail sidings. The Industriehafen on the opposite side of the Neckar contains, beside the usual quay aid loading facilities, many small industrial undertakings, including engineering
      concerns, oil storage plants, and grain silos. This port is the main transhipment centre on the Upper Rhine. Inland Port Ludwigshafen (2) The inland port of Ludwigshafen on the left bank of the Rhine extends from the Southern extremity of the I.G.
      Farbenindustrie Works to the Northern end of the Raschig chemical plant, a total distance of three miles. This is an important transhipment centre for coal and handles a large proportion of the products of the numerous chemical factories in the
      twin-towns. The area includes warehouses, oil storage plants, and grain silos, and is extensively served by rail sidings.

      Elektrizitätswerk Mannheim-Neckarau (1) Built in 1923 to replace the existing three stations at Mannheim, this thermal power station is owned by "Grosskraftwerk Mannheim A.G." and has an installed capacity of 162 MW. It is situated on the east bank
      of the river Rhine in the southern suburbs of Mannheim and is only 2 miles West of the two important sub-stations at Rheinau and three miles East of the sub-station at Mundenheim, being connected to both by high tension transmission lines. It is
      believed that it is also connected, either directly or via Mundenheim, to the nearby I.G. Farben works at Ludwigshafen-Oppau. The station has 11 turbo-generating sets, one of which is housed underground. Cooling water is taken from the river Rhine.
      Underground 20 kV. lines connect the station with the old Mannheim power station which now serves as a sub-station, with the two other old stations in the city with the old Rheinau station and with the Badenwerke sub-station. In addition there is a
      double circuit 110 kV line to Mundenheim sub-station of the Pfalzwerke and to the Rheinau sub-station of the Badenwerke.

      Marienburg is in the extreme West of the province of East Prussia close to the border of the former Danziger Freistaat, and is on the main line fron Northern Germany to Königsberg, forming a junction with a branch line leading to Danzig. It is on the
      river Nogat, which is a tributary of the Vistula, and navigable for small craft. In peacetime there were no industries of great importance, and the town was mainly an agricultural centre. Since the war, however, a Focke-Wulf aircraft works has been
      erected near the town.These works are mentioned below.
    </Description>
    <Aircraft_and_Aero-Engines>
      Focke-Wulf Königsdorf (1) These highly important aircraft works were erected probably in 1941-42 as a result of the decision by Focke-Wulf to transfer aircraft assembly from Bremen to what then seemed to be less vulnerable areas in the East. They
      were built as an assembly plant fed by components from Cottbus, Posen and Kresinki. The works are solely engaged on the assembly of the FW-190 single engine fighter. The works are at the village of Königsdorf, 4 miles East of Marienburg; and one
      mile South of the Marienburg-Elbing highway. Up to August 1943 the plant was still in process of expansion, and more than 1,000 workers, including P's/W were engaged on the excavations.

      oxide and ethylene glycol ethers. This plant was acquired by Chemische Werke Hüls G.m.b.H. owned jointly by I.G.Farbenindustrie and
      <pb n="474" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454633"/>
      Bergwerksgesellschaft Hibernia A.G. (which is owned by the Prussian State). The original capital in 1938 was RM. 30,000,000 of which RM. 22,200,000 belonged to I.G. and 7,800,000 to Hibernia. Construction of a synthetic rubber plant was
      announced early in 1937 and completed in 1940. Unlike the plant at Schkopau, Hüls was designed to make its acetylene from hydrocarbon gases by the electric arc process; otherwise the same four-stage process is used. It is believed that when
      production first started gas was used from the existing coke oven plant, but at a later date a pipe line from the Gelsenkirchen oil plant was completed and presumably the waste hydrocarbon gases from this plant are now used, either alone or in
      conjunction with the coke oven gas. It is believed that the styrene and acrylic nitrile also required for Buna production are made within the works. Power comes principally from a plant within the works of about 150 MW. capacity which is owned by
      Steinkohlen Elektrizität A.G. Essen, (Steag), a subsidiary of the R.W.E. This plant has been leased to Chemische Werke Hüls for fifteen years. Steag has also undertaken to supply any additional current required from its plant at Lünen on the
      Lippe, and a power line with transformer station is already installed. Coal for the coke oven and power plant is brought in by conveyor from Shaft III of the Auguste Viktoria Colliery owned by I.G., which is situated at the eastern boundary of the
      works. There is little doubt that the nominal capacity of Hüls is about 30,000 tons per annum and that output was, at least approximately, restored to this figure early in 1944 after the successful attack of June 1943.</Rubber_and_Tyres>

      Mühldorf is on the River Inn close to the former Austrian border and on the railway line from Munich via Braunau to Austria. A number of important industrial undertakings is grouped in the neighbourhood of this town. The VAWAG have an aluminium works 6
      miles to the East in the small village of Töging. The administrative headquarters of these works are in Mühldorf itself. The pre-war population as given above has probably been increased owing to the expansion of these works. There is an explosives works
      at Kraiburg, 6 miles to the South-west, and further upstream on the River Inn. The works, described below, is one of a number of chemical and explosives factories dispersed over this part of Bavaria. Others are dealt with under the headings Altötting,
      Burghausen, and Trostberg. Five miles to the South-east of Mühldorf, at the village of Steiner am Hart, on a branch railway leading to Trostberg, there is a large calcium carbide and cynamide works. The stretch of the River Inn between Wasserburg and
      Töging, a distance of 25 miles, is utilised for an important hydro-electric scheme.

      Munich (München) is the largest city in Bavaria and the fourth largest in Germany. Prior to 1933 it was the seat of the Bavarian Government. Munich is the birthplace of the Nazi Movement and has become the headquarters of the Nazi Party. The city is
      in the Bavarian highlands, and is 1,700 feet above sea level. It lies to the North of the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, and is on the River Isar. Munich is the centre of an important network of railways and has direct connection with France
      (through Strassburg), with Austria (through Rosenheim), and with Italy (through Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass). Munich was the residence of the Kings of Bavaria. It is a university town, and a cultural centre of European importance. Traditionally
      the city has long been celebrated for artistic handicrafts, including bronze founding, glass staining, silversmith's work, and wood carving, in addition to the manufacture of astronomical and mathematical instruments. During the present century
      a big development of Munich's engineering industry has taken place, and there are now several large works, which are of the highest value to Germany's war production, making railway locomotives, aircraft and other engines, chemicals, and rubber
      tyres. The larger of these firms are mentioned below, including the B.M.W. aero-engine works and the four plants now established in Munich by the Dornier concern. In addition to these, there are reports of further new aircraft and aero-engine
      factories having been opened in the Munich area by Messerschmitt and Daimler-Benz. Also included in the Munich area are the Oberwiesenfeld airfield district North-west of Munich (where the B.M.W. and other works are situated), the suburbs of
      Moosach to the North East, Pasing to the West and Höllriegelskreuth which lies about 5 miles South of Munich. Wolfratshausen, 18 miles South of Munich, where there is a large explosives factory and a reported new Dornier plant, is described under its

      Hydro Scheme Middle Isar (1) Hydro Scheme Uppenborn (1) These electric power systems utilise the water power of the River Isar and consist of two groups of hydro-electric power stations situated to the North-east of Munich. Two diversionary canals
      are used. Seven miles North-east of Munich the Isar is diverted into a large reservoir fron which a canal has been cut to rejoin the river 18 miles to the North near Moosburg. The four power stations of this (the Middle Isar) group are at Finsing
      where the canal leaves the reservoir at Aufkirchen, at Eitting, and at Pfrombach. The capacities of these stations are 11, 36, 32, and 28 MW. respectively. Between Munich and Moosburg the Isar has a course of 32 miles and gives a 290' head to this
      group of stations. The annual electrical output of the Middle Isar group is nearly 500 million kWh and is supplied in approximately equal parts to the State Railways and the city of Munich. From Moosburg to Landshut the canal is continued close to
      the right bank along a 15-mile stretch of the river, giving a head of 60'. This second and smaller group of power stations, known as the Uppenborn group, includes the old Uppenborn station of 8 MW., the new Uppenborn I of 28 MW. and the new Uppenborn
      II of 18 MW. Gasworks Munich (3) Tn 1936 the municipal gasworks of Munich made 2,100 million cu. ft. of coal gas and bought a farther 100 million cu. ft. of sewage gas from the municipal sewage plant at Grosslappen.

      Nürnberg is the second largest city of Bavaria and claims to exceed Munich in the extent of its industrial development. It is a railway centre of great importance as it lies at the intersection of the North-South and the East-West traffic routes.
      Nürnberg was chosen as the centre of the annual Nazi Party rallies and an area of over 2,500 acres to the South-east of the walled city, on the South bank of the Lake known as the Groser Dutzend Teich, was set aside for this purpose. The building
      schemes, which were still in process of completion at the outbreak of war, included numbers of vast public buildings, halls and offices, assembling grounds and arenas, and a gigantic stadium dedicated to the supreme manifestations of Nazi showmanship.
      The old town is to the North of the main railway on either side of the small River Pegnitz, and is surrounded by the original city wall. It is a closely-built area, and its picturesque mediaeval architecture is the chief attraction for Nürnberg's large
      tourist traffic. The principal industrial area is to the South of the main railway station and lies between the suburb of Schweinau and the Südbahnhof. Among the industries are important makers of vehicle engines, tanks, searchlights and electric motors.
      There are other industries at Herrnhütte, an outlying suburb to the North East of the walled city. Fürth, a town of 81,000 inhabitants, which almost joins Nürnberg to the West, is dealt with separately (see page 255).

      Railway Junction Nürnberg (2) Two main railway lines coming from the North and from the West through Bamberg and Würzburg respectively join at Fürth before entering Nürnberg. To the East two lines, which run parallel for some 20 miles, lead into
      Czechoslovakia via Eger and Pilsen. To the South-east is a direct route via Passau to Vienna; To the South the main North to South line continues via Ingolstadt to Munich; and a further line leads from Nürnberg Southwest-wards to Crailsheim and
      Stuttgart. All these are main railway arteries. The junctions are to the East and to the West of the main railway station, approximately one mile apart. Marshalling Yards Südbahnhof (3) The principal marshalling yards of Nürnberg, which are of recent
      construction, are close to the Südbahnhof approximately one mile to the South of the main railway station. They are capable of handling 2,900 wagons per 24 hours.

      Power Station Gebersdorf (2) The thermal powfer station is situated 3 1/2 miles South-west of the main railway station at Gebersdorf, and has an installed capacity of 100 MW. It is owned by Grosskraftwerk Franken A.G. in which company the Nürnberg and
      Fürth Corporations have the controlling interests. The 100 kV switching and transformer station attached to the main Gebersdorf plant is owned by Bayernwerk A.G.; it is located in the Southern area of the plant and is important on account of its focal
      position in the electrical supply system of Southern Germany. It is on the route that is being developed to carry the 220 kV line from the Central Austrian Alps to the Rhineland via Golpa and Dresdorf (Magdeburg). It is believed to be a connecting
      point for the line from the Bayernwerk to Central Germany. Four long-distance 100 kV double-circuit transmission lines run to Bamberg, Kachlet, Würzburg, and Meitingen respectively. A 60 kV line runs to Weissenberg. Local supplies are given at 20
      kV and lower voltages to Nürnberg and district. Gasworks Nürnberg (3) In 1936 the municipal gasworks made 1,600 million cubic feet of gas. A small quantity of sewage gas was also taken from the city sewage plant.

      plant specialised in engines, turbines, boilers and accumulators. The iron and metal foundry had 15 cupola and melting furnaces with an estimated annual capacity of 10,000 tons. These works are second only in importance to the Augsburg factory of the M.A.N.
      concern and now have a similar range of products. They are important builders of Diesel engines and trucks and since 1936 or 1937 have devoted a large proportion of their capacity to the construction of various types of tanks. Approximately 6,000
      workers were employed at the outbreak of war, but it is believed that this number will have been increased. Siemens-Schuckert Katzwangenstr. (2) Siemens-Schuckert Landgrabenstr. (2) The Nürnberg works of the Siemens-Schuckert A.G. are divided into two
      sections, one (Katzwangenstr) being immediately to the South, and the other (Landgrabenstr) approximately 500 yards to the Northwest of the M.A.N. works. The Landgrabenstr. works construct electric motors of all types, including those for U-boats. They
      also manufacture and assemble sound-locators and searchlights. In 1942 they were reported as completing one searchlight per day. Other products of these works include dynamos, generators and electrical firing devices for sea-mines. The Katzwangenstr. works
      are the principal German manufacturers and constructors of electrical transformers, including those of the largest size. These works were heavily damaged by bombing in 1943 and a considerable

      Müller are in the Northeastern suburb of Herrnhütte. They are the leading German producers of special ball-bearings for magnetos, and in this particular high-quality type of bearing they had a larger output than Kugelfischer of Schweinfurt. In
      November 1943 they were reported to be employing 1,000 workers. Their production will assume extra importance owing to the damage to the Schweinfurt plant, and it is possible that they are increasing their output of the heavier types of bearing.
      Faunwerke Wächterstr. (1) The Faunwerke G.m.b.H., whose works are to the North-east of the central city area, are makers of heavy motor vehicles and tractors. Their works have been greatly enlarged and the number of workers employed has been reported
      as high as 14,000. In 1943 they were specialising in 8-cylinder Diesel tractors for use on road and rail, and adjustable to both the Russian and German gauges. The Diesel engines for these tractors were largely supplied by M.A.N. Zündapp Dieselstr.
      (2) The main works of the Zündapp Werke G.m.b.H. are close to and South-west of the Schweinau railway station. Their products include motor-cycles and sidecars, electrical components for searchlights, small explosive-carrying "tanks" directed by
      remote control. There is also a small 50 h.p. Zündapp aero-engine. 4,000 workers are said to be employed by this firm, which has two other plants in Nürnberg. At one of their subsidiary factories munitions and hand grenades are reported to be produced.
      Triumph Werke Fürtherstr. (2) The Triumph Werke Nürnberg A.G., whose works are to the West of the city on the road leading to Fürth, are makers of motor cycles, bicycles, typewriters, and calculating machines. They employed some 2,000 workers
      before the war, having greatly increased their activity during the years 1934 to 1939. They are now believed to be making chiefly motorcycles.

      Apparatefabrik Platenstr. (3) The Süddeutsche Apparatefabrik G.m.b.H. belongs to the Standard Elektrizitäts Ges. A.G. which in its turn was mainly owned by the International Telephone and Telegraph Co. of New York. This Nürnberg factory is to the
      South of the city near to the M.A.N. works. It specialised before the war in the manufacture of selenium discs for wireless rectifiers. The output was 4 million discs per month. In March 1943, the factory was damaged by bombing, but is reported to
      be still partly operating in the old premises and also in other buildings in the town. Nürnberger Schraubenfabrik Paumgartnerstr. (2) Nürnberger Schraubenfabrik Obere Kanal Str. (2) The Nürnberger Schraubenfabrik and Facondreherei are important makers of
      precision screws and nuts for tanks and aircraft, and are believed in 1942 to have been producing 20 per cent of the German requirements. They are also reported to be making shells and small arms ammunition parts. The Paumgartnerstr. factory, which
      is in the East of the city and near the road to Fürth, employed some 1,300 workers before the war. The Obere Kanal Str. works, which are a short distance nearer to the city, are important makers of radio parts, and employed some 800 workers.

      Offenbach is best known as the leading German leather-goods manufacturing centre. It also has a reputation for the manufacture of leather and boots and shoes, and during the past 10 years has developed a modest engineering industry, which is,
      however, still mainly confined to a number of medium sized and smaller firms. The five engineering works listed below under "Engineering and Armaments" have all been extended in the course of the war, but none is individually of outstanding
      importance. In addition to the engineering works and the tanneries and leather goods factories, there is one large chemical plant, of the I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G., which is mainly engaged on the manufacture of dyes and colours. Offenbach is a very
      closely built-up town of only little ackninistrative importance. From a general administrative point of view, it is largely dependent on Darmstadt, the centre of the State of Hesse. As a railway centre Offenbach is of little importance. It is

      the homes of the individual workers, and it may be said that almost every house in this city is a small workshop, but there are two factories built on a larger scale. Gold and silver refining is carried out in Pforzheim in connection with this jewellery
      trade. As was the case during the 1914-1918 war, most of the factories and workshops of Pforzheim will have now been turned over to the manufacture of precision parts for instruments, small-arms components, fuzes, clockwork movements, and

      Stickstoffwerke Piesteritz (1) The large chemical works of the Mitteldeutsche Stickstoffwerke A.G. were merged into the Bayerische Stickstoffwerke A.G. and are now associated with the Ammoniak-Werke Merseburg G.m.b.H. a subsidiary of the I.G.
      Farben concern. The Piesteritz works are important producers of nitrogenous fertilisers, notably nitro-phoska and calcium cyanamide. Nitro-phoska is a combined nitrogen-phosphorus-potash fertiliser. The production of calcium cyanamide for the two
      plants, Piesteritz and Trostberg in Bavaria, is believed to be 125,000 tons per annum. There is also a plant at Piesteritz for the manufacture of concentrated nitric acid, of which the production is 60 tons daily. These works are also reported to be
      the largest producers of phosphorus in Europe. In 1932 it was reported that the annual production was approximately 30,000 tons. There are three 3-phase furnaces, each consuming 12,000 kW. In normal times a large part of this phosphorus was sent to
      Wolfen for the manufacture of phosphoric acid, itself used for making nitro-phoska. Phosphorus is used for the manufacture of incendiary bombs, tracer/incendiary S.A.A., simple tracer S.A.A., and larger-calibre tracer shells made with pyrotechnic
      compositions. Fire-raising ammunition is almost entirely dependent on phosphorus. It is also used in smoke-producing shells for ranging purposes. These chemical works are on the Northern bank of the Elbe on the Western side of Piesteritz.

      and general rubber goods. The plant is now believed to be making fuel-tank covering, respirator face-pieces, and protective clothing. The Piesteritz factory includes a reclaim plant with a capacity of 2,500 tons per annum. At the end of 1943 some
      2,000 workers were employed. It is thought possible that the civilian footwear production has now been transferred to the Kleinwittenberg factory. The Gummiwerke Elbe A.G. is mainly owned by Felten and Guillaume of Cologne.

      I.G. Farbenindustrie Premnitz (1) The Premnitz plant of the I.G. Farben was engaged in 1914/18 in the manufacture of nitrocellulose reaching a peak production of 1,163 tons monthly. After the last war it was converted to the manufacture of
      artificial fibres and greatly enlarged. It is believed that a great deal of nitrocellulose for other than explosive purposes is still made and it seems almost certain that the production of explosive nitrocellulose has also been resumed to some
      extent. A number of the explosives buildings were retained. It is estimated that the total capacity for the production of nitrocellulose is approximately 15,000 tons per annum, of which perhaps one half might be available for explosives manufacture.
      The production of finished propellant powders has been reported here and it is possible that a powder plant of moderate size exists.

    <Description>
      Rathenow is 40 miles West of Berlin on the main line to Hannover. It is on the right bank of the river Havel 20 miles South East of its confluence with the Elbe at Havelberg. Rathenow's chief industry is the manufacture of optical instruments and
      spectacles. The firm of Emil Busch is one of the pioneers of the German optical industry. During the last century this manufacture became a speciality of the town, and there are now a large number of optical instruments (and particularly
      spectacle) manufacturers. In peacetime no other industries are represented on any large scale, but the aircraft works have now become important. Five miles South of Rathenow at Premnitz there is an importnat I.G. Farben plant, which is dealt with
      separately under the heading Premnitz.

      normal range of products include all kinds of camera and other lenses, complete cameras, optical bomb-sights, telescopes, field glasses, microscopes, and other optical instruments. Their chief works are in the centre of the town, and there is a
      subsidiary factory chiefly for glass moulding, which is situated "Am Stadthof" on the bank of the Havel. The Busch works also make the precision metal parts for the optical instruments. Some 2,000 workers were employed before the war and although
      reports state that this number has now been doubled, the Busch works do not compare in importance with the various Zeiss factories or with Leitz of Wetzlar. Nitsche and Günther Dunckerstr. (3) The Nitsche and Günther Optische Werke K.G. are makers
      of optical instruments and special machinery for this industry, including lens polishing apparatus. They supply instrument components to the Busch works. They are believed to employ some 1,200 workers.

      Regensburg is on the South bank of the Danube 60 miles North of Munich, and is an important railway junction and transhipment port. The Danube is navigable as far as Regensburg for barges up to 1,000 tons, and goods can therefore be carried from the
      Black Sea and the Balkans up to Regensburg without transhipment. This port is now of particular value in view of the large amount of Roumanian oil which is shipped to it up the Danube. The pre-war industries of Regensburg also included
      shipbuilding, the manufacture of tiles, drainage pipes and stoneware, and several small engineering works. There are a number of saw-mills, and the inland port handled a large amount of timber. The Regensburg works of the Messerschmitt A.G., have been
      greatly developed during the war. The VAWAG have a large alumina works at Schwandorf, 15 miles to the North on the river Nab, which flows into the Danube 3 miles West of Regensburg. These works are described under the heading of Schwandorf.

      Inland Harbour Regensburg (2) The inland harbour is to the East of the town and on the right bank of the Danube. It has been greatly extended in recent years. In addition to the two original docks, there is now a system of four large docks further to
      the East opening out of an entrance basin two miles upstream from the town. This inland port is of great importance to the traffic in oil from Roumania, a large proportion of which is transhipped at Regensburg. Railway Junction Regensburg (3) Two
      important main railway lines, from Nürnberg eastwards to Passau and Vienna, and from Hof southwards to Munich, meet in Regensburg and, after passing through the railway station, diverge again to the East of the town. Marshalling Yards Regensburg (3)

      Messerschmitt A.G. Prüfening (2) Messerschmitt A.G. Obertraubling (2) The Messerschmitt concern of Augsburg built their first big branch works in 1937 on a site occupying a large area to the West of the town adjacent to the former civil airport on the
      Southern bank of the Danube inside the bend which the river makes North of the village of Prüfening. Production began in 1938 and the plant has concentrated ever since on successive models of the Me.109 single-engined fighter. With the expansion
      programme instituted in the German aircraft industry in 1942-43 output increased considerably until the effective daylight air attack of August 1943. A second Messerschmitt plant has been established by the conversion and extension of a former G.A.F.
      station at Obertraubling, 4 miles to the South-east of Regensburg. This works was engaged on the assembly of the large Messerschmitt transport glider, (the Me.321) and of the powered version of the same aircraft (the 6-engined Me.323). The August
      attack on Prüfening was so effective that Me.109 assembly was for the most part transferred to Obertraubling, while Me.321 and 323 assembly began at Leipheim where assembly space had been acquired. Reconstruction of the Prüfening works was
      vigorously undertaken and production resumed. A series of raids in February 1944 inflicted such severe damage that the plant is thought likely to be abandoned. Obertraubling was bombed in the same February raids with equal effectiveness and no
      attempts at assembly repair work had been
      <pb n="568" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454727"/>

      The Remscheid district is bounded on the East, West and North by the river Wupper and extends South as far as Wermelskirchen. Covering an area of about 40 square miles, it includes the following: Lennep, Lüttringhausen, Bliedinghausen,
      Lennep-Glocke, and Wermelskirchen. Remscheid originated in a group of small villages which were gradually amalgamated by their common interest in light-engineering into a city which has become an important centre for machine tools. There are no
      large works in Remscheid with the exception of the Alexanderwerk A.G. and the very important Deutsche Edelstahl - Bergische Stahlindustrie complex. Other firms specialise in the manufacture of precision instruments, machine tools, as well as all
      types of iron and steel goods.

      Rostock is near the mouth of the River Warnow, which from this point flows through a wide channel to enter the Baltic 6 miles to the North at Warnemünde. It is one of the larger German Baltic ports and a considerable trade with Denmark and Sweden
      is handled in the harbour of Rostock itself and in Warnemünde, which serves as an advanced port. The Neptun shipbuilding concern is an important builder of submarines, and these yards, together with the principal works of the Heinkel concern, make
      Rostock a production centre of the highest value at the present time. These two undertakings form the main part of Rostock's industry. Their output has been considerably reduced by bombing attacks and by the transfer of a large part of the Heinkel
      activities to Oranienburg.
      <pb n="583" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454742"/>
      The town is on the left bank of the Warnow. The central area is closely built and largely composed of buildings dating back to the days of the Hanseatic League. This part of the town was heavily damaged by bombing in 1942. The shipbuilding yards are on
      the Western outskirts of the town, and three of the Heinkel plants are situated in the same area along the railway from Rostock to Warnemünde, which follows the River Warnow approximately half a mile from the left bank. A fourth Heinkel plant is at the
      Eastern end of the town near to the goods station and the gasworks. The other industries, which include chemical plants and a number of minor engineering works, are in the Southern and Western quarters of the town area. Rostock is the largest town in
      Mecklenburg and is the seat of a University.

      Heinkel Marienehe (1) The Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke are the parent works of the company and have four separate branches in the Rostock area, of which the largest is the assembly plant at Marienehe established about 1935, 3 miles to the North of
      Rostock on the road to Warnemünde. This assembly plant employs at least 8,000 workers, including a large proportion of foreign workers. Marienehe was the research and development centre and has been responsible for the design of a long series of
      Heinkel types (bombers, seaplanes, transport types, etc.). The main type produced is the He.111 twin-engined bomber which has been in production in successive versions since 1935. The He.177 heavy bomber has been built in small numbers since 1941,
      but large-scale assembly has been transferred elsewhere (Oranienburg and Arado, Brandenburg). Marienehe still produces the twin - He.111 five - engined glider-towing aircraft. The works are on a large scale with five assembly halls and over 20
      separate machine shops. They have been continually expanded during the past few years. Large-scale production of Heinkel types was also from 1937 undertaken at the Oranienburg subsidiary (He.111's) near Berlin and in 1942-43 at the Schwechat plant

      Neptunwerft Werftstr. (2) The Neptunwerft Rostock Schiffswerft und Maschinenfabrik G.m.b.H. is an important shipyard, who at one time built only merchant ships but since 1938 have been increasingly turned over to warship construction. In the present
      war they have completed a number of 500-ton submarines, escort vessels, and 600-ton mine sweepers. In September 1943 the maximum figure of 9 U-boats were under construction. These yards can also build merchant vessels up to 7,500 tons and in 1943
      commenced work on orders for 3000-ton merchant ships under the German "Hansa" programs. The four building slips vary between 250 and 600 ft. in length and two floating docks of 310 and 400 ft. length are also attached to the yard. In 1941 some 2,000
      workers were reported to be employed, including a high proportion of foreign labourers, the majority of whom were French. The Neptunwerft was undertaking ship repairs on a large scale, this side of the yard's activities having been greatly developed.
      They have important machine shops and produce their own marine steam engines, boilers and superheaters.

      the terms of the Versailles Treaty, making a small quantity of propellant powder for sporting ammunition, and a considerable quantity of nitrocellulose for artificial fibre production. Ground reports suggest that the production of nitrocellulose is
      now somewhat larger than in the last war, and that some high explosive, believed to be T.N.T. was also made. Air photographs confirm the existence of considerable nitrocellulose capacity, but there is no evidence of a T.N.T. unit. These
      photographs suggest that the nitrocellulose capacity probably lies between 8,000 and 10,000 tons per annum.

     <Description>
      General The valley of the river Ruhr lies between those of the rivers Wupper and Lippe, and it extends through the provinces of Rhineland and Westphalia. The industrial targets in the area are concentrated in a
      narrow strip of territory which extends East from the river Rhine and is about 30 miles long and 10 miles wide; and which lies approximately between the river Ruhr and the Rhein-Herne canal. The Ruhr and the adjacent areas in Rhineland and Westphalia
      contain a concentration of industry which is without parallel in Europe. An almost unbroken chain of great industrial cities runs from <city name="Duisburg"> in the West through <city name="Oberhausen">, <city name="Mülheim">, <city name="Essen">, <city name="Gelsenkirchen">, and <city name="Bochum"> to <city name="Dortmund"> in the East.
      Notwithstanding the policy of industrial dispersal and the heavy air attacks, there has been no appreciable movement of heavy industry away from the Ruhr to safer areas and, although strenuous efforts have been made to develop new heavy industrial
      plants elsewhere, the Ruhr area retains nearly all of its pre-war importance as the principal centre of heavy industry in Germany. Division into districts For the purpose of this report the Ruhr has been divided into 14 districts, under which headings
      they should be sought in the text. These conform roughly with the district boundaries as marked on the G.S.G.S. (4081 series) maps of Germany; a map showing these boundaries is included in volume one. West to East these districts are:-

      Rüsselsheim is on the River Main 10 miles East of Mainz. It is the site of the chief works of the Opel concern. These works, which in peacetime were among the largest motorcar manufacturers in Europe, have been greatly expanded during the war, and the
      pre-war population of Rüsselsheim, which is given above, will now have been much increased. The Opel works are now largely engaged on aircraft component as well as motor transport manufacture and the number of workers have been reported as high as
      40,000. The town of Rüsselsheim is entirely concerned with the Opel works, and there are no other industries of importance.
    </Description>
    <Aircraft_and_Aero-Engines>
      Adam Opel A.G. Rüsselsheim (2) Certain departments of the Opel car works were in 1939-40 turned over or expanded for aircraft components manufacture and the present note relates only to that side of their work. The heavy press capacity at
      Rüsselsheim is partly devoted to the fabrication of Ju.88 bomber components for supply to the assembly plants at Bernburg and elsewhere. These components include the frameworks for cockpit covers, for transparent nose units and for gun turret
      covers. In addition aero-engine bearers, cowlings and nacelles are made, together with undercarriages and tail wheels, all for the same type of aircraft.
      <pb n="590" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454749"/>
      In a special department airscrew reduction gears for fitting to Daimler-Benz aero-engines are made and supplied to the D.B. aero-engine factories. The Rüsselsheim works is also believed to be an important producer of tools, jigs and dies required in
      other aircraft factories in Germany. Only a proportion (possibly 3,000) of the total employed at Rüsselsheim are concerned with the above aircraft components work.

    <Engineering_and_Armaments>
      Adam Opel A.G. Rüsselsheim (1) These works, occupying a large site West and South West of Rüsselsheim, with a quay frontage on the South bank of the Main, at one time produced the Opel range of cars and lorries. They were owned by General Motors.
      Their pre-war output was up to 120,000 units annually, the works having a productive capacity at the rate of 200,000 units per annum. In 1935, lorry production was transferred to a new plant at Brandenburg, many of the components continuing to be
      made at Rüsselsheim, however. At the outbreak of war car production was stopped and a portion of the plant was converted to the manufacture of air-frame components for Junkers 88 aircraft. Aircraft propellor reduction gearing for Daimler-Benz
      aircraft engines was also manufactured. In addition, large quantities of vehicle spare parts continued to be made, Rüsselsheim being responsible for maintaining the Opel service and repairs organisation, whilst parts were sent to the lorry producing
      plant at Brandenburg. It was reported early in 1943 that Rüsselsheim was to concentrate upon lorry production, and several reports concerning the manufacture of lorries at this plant have been received. On the other hand, several references to the
      manufacture of aircraft engines have been received in 1943. In addition, reference has been made to the manufacture of armoured cars, tracked motor cycles, and amphibious vehicles. The number of workers has been variously reported and the whole
      Rüsselsheim complex would appear to employ 20,000 to 25,000 workers including a large number of foreigners.

      Hydro Scheme Saale (2) With the primary object of improving the navigation of the river Elbe in dry periods and of preventing flood damage, two large dams have been erected at Bleiloch and Hohenwarte to control the inflow of the Saale, a tributary of
      the Elbe. These dams and their reservoirs, which impound a water volume almost equal to the annual flow of the Saale, are among the largest in Germany. The water power thus created is used to serve an important hydro scheme. The four generating
      stations described below are now fully developed, and it is probable that plans exist for further constructions which will greatly increase the output. Near Saalburg, 20 miles South-east of Saalfeld, is the Bleiloch dam and reservoir and its
      adjacent Burgkhammer compensating reservoir. The generating stations of these two have capacities of 40 MW and 5 MW respectively. A pump-storage station operates between the two reservoirs. Four miles South-east of Saalfeld, near the village of
      Kaulsdorf, is the Hohenwarte dam and reservoir and its adjacent Eichicht compensating reservoir. The generating stations of these two have capacities of 50 MW and 5 MW respectively. A pump-storage station operates between the two reservoirs.
      <pb n="592" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454751"/>
      It is planned to construct a further pump-storage station of 368 MW capacity using the Eichicht compensating reservoir as a lower reservoir and a high level reservoir in the hills on the left bank of the River Saale. An indoor substation, owned by
      the Thüringenwerke A.G., Weimar, is situated 270 feet above the Bleiloch generating station, and contains two 10/50/100 kV transformers of 20 MW. capacity. 100 kV lines go to Herlasgrün and Hof. A 50 kV double-circuit line goes to Jena. Local supplies
      are given at 10 kV and the stations of the group are inter-connected at this voltage. The planned 220 kV long-distance line linking the power stations of the Alps with central and eastern industrial Germany will pass through Bleiloch via Gebersdorf.

      Saarbrücken is the largest town in the Saar territory and a most important industrial and coal-mining centre. It is near the southern boundary of the Saar area and is on a main railway line which follows the valley of the River Saar to Trier.
      Saarbrücken is a railway junction for several branch lines serving the industrial regions of the Saar and of Lorraine. The coalfields of the Saar Basin, which extend mainly to the North of the town, are among the largest in Europe and, together with
      the rich iron-ore deposits of Lorraine, they yield raw material for the highly-developed iron and steel industry in these regions. Several iron and steel works are established in Saarbrücken itself. The industries include a number of engineering
      works which, though individually on a small scale, constitute in the aggregate a valuable factor in the German war production. The industrial area extends along the valley of the River Saar from the outskirts of Völlingen (5 miles to the West) to
      Brebach and Neuscheidt, 3 miles to the East of Saarbrücken. The river Saar is navigable and is an important means of transport for the products of this region.

      The great iron ore deposits of Salzgitter just north of Goslar in the Harz region and S.S.W. of Brunswick have been worked on a small scale for many years, and, following the loss of Lorraine in 1919, their large scale operation was discussed by German
      geologists and metallurgists. According to a report published in 1934 by the Prussian Geological Institute (Die Eisenerzvorrate des Deutschen Reiches) the size of the deposits of ore that could be worked as an economic proposition was 35 million tons
      while there was a further 65 million tons of ore that would require more favourable business conditions such as cheap freight and higher steel prices before it could be considered. These two categories of ore were at a depth of a few feet to
      nearly 1,000 feet below the surface, but going to a depth of 3,500 feet at least 400 million tons of ore were available. It has since been stated that the estimate of volume of ore was much too low. Features common to all the Salzgitter ores are their
      high phosphorus content, which makes them suitable for the basic Bessemer process, and their high silica content, which, until the discovery by Brassert of the means of using acid burdens in blast furnaces, rendered them unsuitable for smelting without
      the mixture of other ores. The greater part of the Salzgitter ores have an extremely low iron content but among the best grades are some with an iron content of about 40 per cent. Before the introduction of the Brassert process and the erection of the
      Reichswerke Hermann Göring, the best Salzgitter ores were mined to the extent of a few hundred thousand tons per annum by the nearby Ilseder Hütte of Peine, which mixed them with the limey Peine ores, and by certain Ruhr works which mixed them with
      imported ores. Following the successful introduction in the mid-thirties of acid burdening at Corby in Northamptonshire where the ores are also sicilious, the large scale working of Salzgitter ores became a practical proposition provided a works was
      erected on the spot. In pursuance of its policy of aiming at raw material self-sufficiency the Nazi Government therefore decided to build such a plant and to link it by a special canal with the Mittelland Canal so as to provide cheap transport to
      and from the Ruhr. In the barges bringing the necessary coking coal for the works' own coke ovens it was planned to send back Salzgitter ore to the Ruhr works. Thus, as a result of Government action, conditions were created for the use of Salzgitter ores
      to an extent far exceeding anything conceived by the Prussian Geological substitute. There are now a number of iron ore mines in operation in this area. As already indicated some are of the surface or quarry type and none represent suitable "objectives".

      Buna Werke Schkopau (1+) The Schkopau plant of the Buna Werke G.m.b.H, is the largest of the German synthetic rubber plants. The original experimental works were begun in 1936, and the present factory first went into production in 1939 with a planned
      final capacity of 25,000 tons per annum. Further expansions of the works during the war have increased this capacity to at least 50,000 tons per annum. This exceeds the present estimated capacity of the Hüls works, the second of the two leading
      German synthetic rubber plants, which is described under the heading Marl. The Schkopau plant produces the synthetic rubber from carbide, whereas the Hüls plant operates from methane-ethane gas. At least 20,000 workers are believed to be employed at

      Lignose Bad Salzelmen (2) This factory is operated by the Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H. Ground reports have suggested that the output of T.N.T. at this plant is very large indeed. Some reports put it as high as 60,000 tons per annum. Examination of
      photographic cover prior to the attack on the plant early in 1944 suggests that on the basis of the size of buildings, etc., the T.N.T. capacity may be of the order of 40,000 tons per annum. There are two large T.N.T. manufacturing units which
      appear to be identical, and one smaller unit of somewhat different layout. Some new
      <pb n="606" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454765"/>
      construction was then in hand, but it is not yet clear whether this was intended for high-explosives manufacture or not. The photographs suggest that, in addition to T.N.T. amatol is also prepared in this plant by mixing some part of the T.N.T.
      production with ammonium nitrate. This may be the explanation of the very high figures for T.N.T. output which have been given from some sources. Ground sources have suggested that there are two factories making explosives at Schönebeck. This is
      not confirmed by air photographs, and it is suggested that the second explosives factory reported is in fact the Patronen Zündhütchen und Metallwarenfabrik, which is a fuse-making establishment in the neighbourhood, and which has mounded buildings
      for the storage of explosives and detonators. The high-explosives factory lies in open country on rising ground on the south bank of the river Elbe, about 2 km. due west of Schönebeck railway station, and 1 1/2 km. south-west from the river bank.
      Ground reports have stated that shells are also filled in this factory, but air photographs do not confirm this, and it would be very unusual practice to use an explosives factory for filling weapons. It is probable, however, that there is a filling
      factory in the immediate neighbourhood. The factory was almost completely destroyed only in 1944, probably as a by-product of the raid of January 21/22, 1944 on Magdeburg. Chemische Werke Schönebeck (-) The Chemische Werke Schönebeck A.G. are makers

      Schramberg is in the central area of the Black Forest 30 miles North-east of Freiburg. It is at the terminus of a small branch railway from Schiltach which in its turn is connected at Hausach with the main railway line from Offenburg through the Black
      Forest to Donaueschingen. As with many similar remote towns in the Black Forest, watch and clock making is the traditional industry. In the case of Schramberg, however, the development of the firm of Junghans has given the town outstanding importance in
      this branch. Apart from a few minor watch makers, the activities of Schramberg are entirely concerned with the Junghans works.
    </Description>
    <Engineering_and_Armaments>
      Junghans Schramberg (1) The Gebr. Junghans A.G. Uhrenfabriken are the largest individual firm of watch and clock makers in the Black Forest area. In peacetime they employed some 5,000 workers and were capable of producing watches and clocks at the
      rate of 27,000 daily. The parent works of the concern are in Schramberg and include, in addition to the large watch-making factory, a section devoted to the manufacture of the precision tools required in this industry. A separate saw mill and
      woodworking factory, also in Schramberg, prepares the wooden casings for the clocks. The works has its own hydro-electric power plant. A branch factory in Lehengericht, 5 miles North of Schramberg, makes watch springs. There is a second smaller
      watch factory in Schwenningen 15 miles to the South East of Schramberg, and a components factory in Rottenburg 30 miles to the North-east of Schramberg. The factories in Schramberg, which are now said to number three separate plants, are believed
      to employ some 13,000 workers and, in addition to a fairly wide range of precision instruments, are now largely turned over to the manufacture of fuzes.
      <pb n="608" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454767"/>
      Together with the firm Gebr. Thiel of Ruhla in Thuringia, this production of fuzes is reported to amount to 100,000 daily. There is an apprentices' school in Schramberg where up to 200 mechanics and watch makers are under training. During the latter
      half of 1943 the number of foreign workers, which had hitherto been small, was increasing continually, mostly Frenchmen and Ukrainians of both sexes being engaged. Although the firm's payroll has increased from 5,000 to 13,000 in the course of the
      war it is unlikely that the number of workers actually employed in the Junghans factories has increased to any major extent because they were already working to capacity before the war. It is assumed that some 7,000 to 8,000 workers are employed by
      sub-contractors or are "home workers".

      Schweinfurt is in the North-western area of Bavaria on the North bank of the River Main, 25 miles North-west of Würzburg. It is on the railway route from Northern Germany to Stuttgart and on the East to West line from Bamberg to Mainz and the Rhine
      valley. The Main is already navigable for heavy barges as far as Aschaffenburg, but it is possible that the project to connect the Main with the Danube has already progressed upstream beyond Schweinfurt, in which case the hitherto small inland harbour
      will have increased in importance. Schweinfurt is the largest centre of the German ball bearing industry and normally produces well over half the total requirements. This manufacture is carried on mainly in four large factories which are grouped round
      the main railway station on the South-western outskirts of the town. The technical equipment and individual skill required in this industry, on which many engineering and armament branches depend have been developed over a long period and have made Schweinfurt a highly
      specialised industrial community which it is difficult to transplant or replace. As a result of several bombing attacks very severe damage has been done to the four principal factories.

      Inland Harbour Schweinfurt (3) There is a small harbour on the North bank of the River Main in the industrial district of Schweinfurt to the West of the town centre. This harbour, which is served by railway sidings, is close to the V.K.F. plant.
      Until 1939 only the smaller barges could proceed up the Main beyond Aschaffenburg, but it is possible that the Main-Danube canal project is now sufficiently advanced for heavier traffic to reach Schweinfurt and Bamberg.

      V.K.F. (N/A) When in full production the group of Schweinfurt factories belonging to this concern formed by far the most important unit in the German ball-bearing industry. The V.K.F. group employed at least 10,000 workers. The chief plants are
      described below. This concern extended its range of production during the war to include taper-roIler, barrel-roller and the heaviest types of bearings. V.K.F. Werk I (Schweinfurter Präzisions-Kugellagerwerke Fichtel and Sachs, Wälzlager
      Abteilung) Schweinfurt (1)X This factory was purchased from the Schweinfurt firm of Fichtel and Sachs in 1929. In 1938, 3,000 to 3,500 workers were employed. It produced all types of bearing, including the majority of the German output of precision
      bearings, and concentrated particularly on the finishing and assembling processes, receiving part of its requirements of semi-products from V.K.F. Werk II and other sources. V.K.F. Werk II (Deutsche Gusstahlkugel and Maschinenfabrik A.G. vorm.
      Fries and Höpflinger) Schweinfurt (1)X This factory was also acquired in 1929. It produced all types of bearings, and was also engaged in the production of balls and the machining of races for Werk I, where the finishing and final assembly was
      carried out. 4,500 to 5,000 workers were employed in 1938. It is believed that the plant has been extended since the war by taking over neighbouring premises. In addition to standard varieties of bearing, these two works have also, in recent years,
      taken up the manufacture of the heaviest types of bearings, as well as taper-roller and barrel-roller bearings. These had formerly been imported from Sweden. Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.m.b.H. Schweinfurt (2)X The section of the V.K.F. concern known
      as the Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.m.b.H. was before the war engaged exclusively on the production of ball-bearing cages. They supplied these to the other ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt and to the open market. Approximately 1,000 workers were
      employed. X The priority ratings are based op the pre-raid value of these objectives.
      <pb n="615" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454774"/>
      Kugelfischer (Erste Automatische Gusstahlfabrik vormals F. Fischer) Schweinfurt (1+)X The Schweinfurt plant of the Kugelfischer Schoefer A.G. combine is immediately North of the railway line and main station. It is the largest single factory in the
      German ball bearing industry and produced all types of ball and roller bearings, with the exception of the heaviest industrial bearings, before the war. 5,000 to 6,000 hands were employed in 1938, but figure had risen to 7,000 by 1939. The size of the
      works has been much increased since the outbreak of war. It is, therefore, the largest individual factory in the German ball bearing industry, and reports received prior to the air attacks suggested that as many as 12,000 workers were
      employed. Fichtel and Sachs Ernst Sachs Str. (1)X The ball bearing factory belonging to this firm was taken over by the V.K.F. and is now Werk I of that concern as mentioned above. The firm of Fichtel and Sachs, though possibly now affiliated with the
      V.K.F. concern, still retains its identity and continues to operate under its own name. The works make light weight motorcycles, motor boat engines, cycle hubs and other motor vehicle components, including the F and S patent clutch which is widely
      used in the German motor industry. A limited range of small ball-bearings for use in their own products is produced in the section of the plant retained by Fichtel and Sachs. The works has been enlarged since 1939 and reports suggest that the new
      workshops are mainly engaged on the manufacture of motor vehicle components for the open market and small arms components and ammunition.

      Siegburg is East of the Rhine and 10 miles South-east of Cologne. It is on the River Sieg, a tributary which flows into the Rhine opposite Bonn, 5 miles South-west of Siegburg. Two miles to the North-west of Siegburg is the neighbouring settlement of
      Troisdorf (which had a pre-war population of 10,000) where there are works belonging to the Klöckner concern and a large explosives factory. The industry of Siegburg itself, apart from the cellulose factory mentioned below, is largely the making of fire
      bricks and tiles, furniture making and woodworking.</Description>
    <Iron__Steel_and_Ferro-Alloys>Klöckner Troisdorf (3) The Mannstaedt works of the Klöckner Werke A.G. at Troisdorf include a foundry and cold-rolling mills producing profiles, frames (including chassis frames), girders, sections, and forgings. The
      iron and steel plant belonging to this works is estimated to have an annual capacity of 50,000 tons of pig iron.

      Dynamit A.G. Troisdorf (1) This factory is operated by Dynamit A.G., and was of considerable importance in 1914/18 During the peace years the factory was greatly extended, and took over a great many activities, apart from the production of
      explosives. Not only is nitro-cellulose made in large quantities for the production of celluloid-type plastics, but a variety of other plastic materials,
      <pb n="623" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454782"/>
      among which laminated articles made from bakelite are perhaps the most important, are also made here. It is quite likely that some explosive nitrocellulose is still manufactured here, and indeed this view is supported by the examination of air
      photographs. It is difficult to estimate what part of the nitrocellulose capacity is available for explosives manufacture. The total installed capacity represents about 12,000 tons per annum, but the majority of this will certainly be used for
      plastics manufacture. The factory is important as being one of the largest producers of detonators in Germany. It introduced the manufacture of lead azide detonators in aluminium caps. Even before the war the production of these detonators was
      running at the rate of about 120 million per annum, and there is little doubt that it has been increased since. The factory prepares its own raw materials for detonators, having a sodium azide plant with an output in excess of 160 tons per annum. The
      factory is situated 13 miles south-east of Cologne.

      Siegen is situated at the Northern end of the extensive iron-ore deposit of Siegerland-Wieder. The iron ore of this area is among the best that is mined in Germany; it is non—phosphoric and suitable for the production of spiegeleisen and also contains
      a proportion of manganese. In 1937 the area produced a minimum amount of 1,517,000 tons of iron ore and employed 4,900 workmen. The output was mostly consumed by local blast furnaces though a little found its way to Rhenisch-Westphalia. Siegen is also a
      junction for three minor branch lines. It is at the Southern end of a line of industrial settlements which extend, mostly along the valley of the River Lenne, from Siegen to the vicinity of Hagen, and which contain a large number of rolling mills, wire
      drawing, and metal working plants, and foundries. Siegen itself has a number of foundries specialising in the production of rollers for steel rolling mills, and is responsible for a high proportion of the German requirements of this essential
      component. The principal works of this kind are mentioned below. Another group 3 miles to the North of the town are dealt with under the heading Geisweid.

      Rheinmetall-Borsig Sömmerda (2) The Sömmerda factory of this concern in peacetime made typewriters and calculating machines, of which Rheinmetall was a large producer. Motorcar driving shafts and other components were also made. The plant is now
      making bomb components, principally light-alloy parts, fuzes, incendiary bomb casings, delayed action mechanisms, and electrical components. One section of the works is making leaf springs and transmission shafts for tanks. Over 3,000 workers are
      believed to be employed. Selve Kronbiegel Sömmerda (2) The Selve Kronbiegel-Dornheim A.G. were prior to the war manufacturers of detonators and sporting ammunition. They are now important makers of S.A.A. and are believed to have increased the number
      of their workers from 900, which was their peacetime complement, to over 3,000. The company, which originated in Altena, acquired the munition firms Braun and Bloem of Düsseldorf and Dreyse and Collenbusch of Sömmerda, and in 1925 transferred their

      for it. A report dated 1938 states that while over 400,000 square metres of land were allocated to the factory, only some 22,000 square metres had been used for buildings at that time. Photographic reconnaissance of July, 1942, shows that the factory
      has now been much enlarged. Its chief function is plainly the manufacture of T.N.T., and it is estimated on the basis of size of buildings that its output would be at least 20,000 tons per annum. It seems likely that penthrite or tetryl are also
      made at this factory, and there are certain buildings similar to those usually associated with the manufacture of detonators.</Chemicals_and_Explosives>

      Stettin is at the mouth of the River Oder and is Germany's largest Baltic port. It is the nearest port to Berlin, which lies 84 miles to the South-west. It has direct rail communications with Berlin, Frankfurt (Oder), and Danzig, and through the River
      Oder is joined up to the main North German inland-waterway system. It plays an important part in the seaborne supply arrangements for the Eastern Front. The central area of Stettin is a compact mass composed mainly of dwelling houses and offices. The
      industrial area extends along the river from the dock area in the south-eastern quarter of the city northwards along the left bank to Gutzlow. Most of the important industrial plants are in this area. The main industry of Stettin is connected with its
      shipyards. No large vessels are built here, but there is considerable activity in the building and fitting-out of submarines, minesweepers, naval escort vessels, and tank landing craft. The shipyard area is in the neighbourhood of Grabow, which is on
      the left bank of the river one mile to the North of the main railway bridge. The Vulkan shipyards have been considerably extended during the war. Opposite the shipbuilding yards is the Bredow Werder, a large island in the channel of the Oder, which is in
      process of being converted into an industrial area and naval base. At the South end of this island a large dock basin has been excavated. The port or dock area is on the right bank of the Oder immediately North of the marshalling yards, and in the
      neighbourhood of the docks is a large concentration of warehouses, timber yards, oil depots, and small factories.

      Port Area Stettin (2) The port and dock area are opposite the centre of the town on the right bank of the Oder. There are two harbours with rail sidings which lead from the marshalling yards immediately to the South East. The Freihafen, one of the
      docks immediately opposite to the city centre, has some of the largest dock warehouses in Europe, including a large grain elevator. The whole dock area, including the island known as the Silber-Wiese, at the point where the main railway crosses the
      Oder, is closely built with warehouses, timber yards, saw mills, oil storage depots, and small factories. Stettin is an important transhipment centre for the Upper Silesian coal which is conveyed in barges down the Oder direct from the coalfields.
      Railway Centre Stettin (2) The main line from Berlin, which continues beyond Stettin north-eastwards parallel with the Baltic coast, forms a direct route from Berlin to Danzig. Other lines radiate from Stettin north-westwards to Stralsund, south-
      wards to Küstrin, and northwards via Gollnow round the Eastern side of the Stettiner Haff to Swinemünde. Three other minor branch lines serve the agricultural districts to the West and South-west of the town. Marshalling Yards Stettin (3) The
      marshalling yard has a capacity for handling 2,500 wagons per 24 hours. It is connected with the chief goods station which handles traffic arriving on the Oder for despatch to Berlin, and goods from Berlin and Breslau for shipment to the Baltic
      ports. It is also the clearing station for the eastern coastal districts of the Baltic.

      branch of the Oder. The station is unique in its construction. Built shortly before the during the war, it is designed to afford the greatest possible concealment and protection against air attack and is built into the edge of a cliff with part of
      the plant underground. The open-air switching station is situated about 100 yards to the West; several overhead lines are connected to it and though their routes are not known it is assumed that one at least connects to Stettin. Power Station
      Altdammerstrasse (2) This thermal power station is situated in the S-E suburbs of Stettin on the river Parnitz, a tributary of the Oder; it is owned by the Grosskraftwerk Stettin A.G. (controlled by the Stettin Corporation), and has an installed
      capacity of 91 MW. Stettin and district receive electricity supplies mainly from this station via the transmission system of the Märkisches Elektrizitätswerk (MEW), which owns several generating stations in this area including the Oderkraftwerk at
      Pommerensdorf. Districts supplied include Greifenhagen, 12 miles South; Prenzlau, 30 miles West; and the district round the river Randow, 16 miles North. An open-air substation connects the station to the 100 kV transmission system. Lines at this
      voltage are believed to connect to Pasewalk, Stargard, the Oderkraftwerk, and Pölitz. Power Stations Pölitz (1) The two thermal power stations, Pölitz I and II, form part of the synthetic-oil plant situated about 8 miles North of Stettin; they belong
      to the Hydrierwerke Pölitz A.G. and have a combined installed capacity of 300 MW. Pölitz I, the most southerly, has an installed capacity of 225 MW; Pölitz II, 250 yards to the North, was completed in 1943 and has an installed capacity of 75 MW. The
      estimated requirements of the synthetic-oil plant are 300 MW, with an annual consumption of about 2 million kWh; these are supplied by medium and low voltage underground cables. Steam is also supplied to the plant. A large open-air substation is
      situated in the Western area of the works, to which at least 2 high-voltage overhead lines are connected; one of these probably connects to Stettin, and the other to Steinstrasse.

      Stuttgart, the capital of Württemberg, is the most important industrial town in Southern Germany. It lies in a valley surrounded by wooded hills which open out in the East into the valley of the river Neckar. The town has grown in size considerably
      since the end of the last century, the development being due mainly to the engineering industry consisting principally of light and electrical engineering. Together with the adjoining suburb of Zuffenhausen, Feuerbach forms one of the chief
      industrialised quarters of the Stuttgart district. The second industrial area is in Cannstatt and Münster, which are to the North of the city centre and on the left bank of the river Neckar. This area includes an important ball-bearing works, the
      town's electric power station, and several precision-engineering works. A third industrial district is East of the city centre and on the right bank of the river, extending Southeastward from Untertürkheim up the river valley to Esslingen. The highly
      important main plant of the Daimler-Benz concern is in Untertürkheim, which also contains large marshalling yards and railway-repair shops. Halfway between Untertürkheim and Esslingen are the "Index" works of Hahn and Tessky, one of Germany's leading
      makers of machine tools. The manufacture of machine tools and measuring instruments is a highly-developed industry in Stuttgart and also in the neighbouring settlements of Esslingen, 4 miles to the South-east. It is characteristic of Stuttgart, as indeed
      of the whole of Württemberg, that in normal times industry tends to remain in the hands of a large number of medium-sized or small firms. This is particularly the case with machine tools, and it is, therefore, not possible to include all the numerous
      firms which in the aggregate make Stuttgart a vital factor in the German engineering industry. Stuttgart is an important railway centre and is on the main routes from the North to Zurich and from Munich to Karlsruhe and France.

      Power Station Stuttgart (2) This thermal power station is situated in Münster, a northern suburb of Cannstatt. It is owned by the Stuttgart Corporation and has an installed capacity of 87 MW. In addition to the general town supply, power is delivered
      for railway traction. There are no important long-distance supplies. An adjacent 6/110 kV substation is owned by Elektrizitäts-Versorgung Württemberg A.G. and provides supplies for traction locally and via a 110-kV transmission line through
      Plochingen to Pasing to serve the electrified Stuttgart-Ulm-Augsburg-Munich railway line (single-phase circuit). A substation for 3/10 kV transmits supplies locally. Medium-voltage lines connect to Degerloch and Obertürkheim. Power Station Marbach
      (2) The Marbach plant consists of a large thermal station, begun in 1938 and completed since the outbreak of war, and a small hydro station, and has an installed capacity of 108 MW. It is situated on the river Neckar about 10 miles North of
      Stuttgart and this relatively remote location was probably chosen mainly as an air-raid precaution. It is believed that practically the whole electrical output is supplied to the grid at the 220-kV Hoheneck substation and the 110-kV Obertürkheim sub-
      station from whence a part is transmitted to Stuttgart. The small hydro station has an installed capacity of 3 MW. An outdoor substation contains 4 double-circuit 110-kV lines, of which one, possibly two, connects to Obertürkheim and two to Hoheneck.
      <pb n="659" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454819"/>
      Substation Hoheneck (2) This important substation is situated 2 miles South-west of the Marbach generating station. It is being extended and identification is therefore uncertain. The station is on the 220-kV (planned 380—kV) long-distance line which
      links the waterpower stations of the mountainous regions on the southern frontiers of Germany with the Ruhr industrial area. There are three adjoining sections for 220 kV, 110 kV and 60 kV respectively. Each section has duplicate busbars. Two
      380/220-kV circuits connect to Rheinau and two to Herbertingen. One 220-kV circuit connects to Ellwangen. Two (possibly) 110-kV circuits connect to Pforzheim and two (possibly) to Heilbronn. Two double 110-kV circuits are under construction to
      Marbach station. Two 60-kV circuits go to Heilbronn, two to Pleideslheim, and one to Enzberg. It is believed that there are transformers for voltages lower than 60 kV. Gas Works Stuttgart (3) The municipal gas works made 3,100 million cubic feet of
      gas in 1936. Supplies are given to a large number of localities around Stuttgart.

      particularly radio equipment. Leichtmetallbau G.m.b.H. Bad Cannstatt (3) It is believed that this firm employs 3/400 workers on the manufacture of aircraft components, in particular shock absorbers and components for aircraft undercarriages,
      brakes, and other aircraft equipment. J. Eberspächer Esslingen (3) This factory has been considerably enlarged since 1939, and has acquired at least one of the neighbouring factory sites, apart from erecting two new workshops adjacent to its old
      premises. It is believed to be engaged mainly on the manufacture of aircraft components and cylinder-baffling silencers, air filters, and other aero-engine components. Other products of the firm are components for flame throwers, and reports
      suggest that a number of other firms in Esslingen supply Eberspächer with major and minor components for flame throwers, indicating that assembly of flame throwers is likely to be undertaken by them.

      Daimler-Benz A.G. Untertürkheim (1) The principal pre-war activity of this company was the manufacture of motor vehicles, and it is believed that the major part of the very extensive old Daimler-Benz works at Untertürkheim is still employed on work
      connected with the motor-vehicle industry. This aspect of the Daimler-Benz production is dealt with below, under "Engineering and Armaments", and the following relates exclusively to those parts of the works which are believed to be engaged on
      aero-engine work. For several years prior to the war the Daimler-Benz company undertook the development of aero-engines, and prototypes were built and tested at this works. It is thought that up to 1939 no large-scale production of aero-engines
      was undertaken, except at the branch factories at Genshagen and Marienfelde, near Berlin. Reports suggest that these two factories were supplied with components from Untertürkheim. It is not definitely known when the complete construction of aero-
      engines at Untertürkheim commenced, but it seems probable that it was during the early part of 1942. Up to the end of that year aero-engines erected at Untertürkheim were transported to Sindelfingen for testing, but since then the Untertürkheim works
      has been very greatly extended, and it is clear from reconnaissance photographs that most of the sections are connected with the production of aero-engines, which is now taking place at Stuttgart on a large scale. Several series of engine test-beds
      have been erected, and it is believed that Untertürkheim now represents one of the principal production centres for Daimler-Benz engines.

      Daimler-Benz A.G. Untertürkheim (1) Owing to its interests in other industries (particularly the aero-engine industry - see above) the Daimler-Benz company is the largest motor-vehicle concern in Germany. In terms of output the Untertürkheim plant is
      second only to Opel, its 1938 production figures being 20,000 passenger cars and 6,000 commercial vehicles. There is reason to believe that the manufacture of commercial vehicles, particularly lorries, has increased considerably in the course of the
      war, and that there has been a corresponding decline in the output of cars, production of which is confined mainly to military types. Several sections of the Untertürkheim plant are engaged on the manufacture of components for motor vehicles, which
      are partly supplied to
      <pb n="662" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454822"/>
      their branch works at Gaggenau and Sindelfingen. No definite information regarding the number of workers at present employed at Untertürkheim is available, but ground reports suggest that the total is approximately 20,000, including the very large
      number of workers employed in the aero-engine sections described above (under "Aircraft and Aero-Engines"). Robert Bosch A.G. a) Feuerbach (1+) b) Stuttgart-Militär Str. (1) The principal works of this firm is at Feuerbach, a suburb of Stuttgart. A
      second works in this area is in the middle of Stuttgart (west of the main railway station) but although it has been repeatedly extended since 1939 it is not as important as the Feuerbach works. The outstanding value of the Bosch works to the German
      armament industry is their very large output of fuel injection pumps, magnetos, sparking plugs, and batteries, as well as the usual Bosch range of electrical accessories for internal combustion engines. In addition the Feuerbach and Stuttgart works
      make a wide range of other electrical appliances such as components for search-lights, head-lamps,etc., but there are, of course, only of secondary importance. Bosch operate a subsidiary factory at Klein-Machnow near and also an affiliated factory
      in German occupied territory but it is estimated that the Stuttgart factories of Bosch still account for more than half of Germany's total requirements of fuel injection pumps, magnetos, sparking plugs, and other electrical accessories for internal
      combustion engines. It is estimated that the Feuerbach works employs some 20,000 workers and that a further 10,000 hands are engaged at Stuttgart-Militär Str. Zeiss Ikon (Contessa) Dornhalderstr. (2) The Stuttgart works of the Zeiss Ikon A.G. of
      Dresden are known as the Contessa Werke. This branch specialises in the manufacture of cameras and photographic appliances of all kinds. It is now believed that their range of products has been widened to include the grinding and polishing of optical
      lenses and a wide range of optical instruments. Some 2,000 workers were reported to be employed in 1942.

      Adolf Zaiser Maschinenfabrik G.m.b.H. employed some 400 workers before the war, and were makers of elevators and framed steel structures. Adolf Friz G.m.b.H. Haldenstr. (3) The firm of Adolf Friz G.m.b.H., whose works are in Cannstatt, produced
      machinery for the woodworking industry before the war but are reported now to be making the moveable parts of watertight compartments for submarines on a large scale and are also said to be assembling steering-gear components. The reports suggest
      that some 300 workers were employed in 1943. J.C. Eckardt A.G. Pragstr. (3) Carl Mahr Plichingerstr. (3) Julius Ortlieb Mettingenstr. (3) The J.C. Eckardt A.G., whose works are in Bad Cannstatt, are makers of pressure gauges for use in submarines,
      manometers and pressure indicators, and thermometers for use in aircraft. Before the war they employed some 200 workers. The two other firms mentioned above, whose works are both in Esslingen, have a similar range of products and are approximately
      equal in size.

      largest German ball-bearing works outside Schweinfurt. These works specialise in the production of the smaller sizes of ball bearings, such as are used in peace-time in textile machinery, and particularly in small precision bearings for magnetos,
      for which the Norma is the principal supplier to the Bosch works. This factory is also responsible for a large proportion of the bearings used in aircraft controls, predictors and other instruments. The Norma plant has been greatly extended in recent
      years. Several thousand workers were employed in 1943. Esslinger Maschinenfabrik Esslingen (1) The Esslinger Maschinenfabrik A.G. are important makers of locomotives, including main-line locomotives (of which their output has been reported as 15
      per month), stationary steam engines, boilers, pumps, compressors, refrigeration plant, tank wagons, and constructional steel products. They employed some 3,000 workers before the war and it is believed that this number has now increased. Ground
      intelligence suggests that a number of new departments were opened in the course of 1942 and are specialising in the manufacture of components for the standard—type locomotive. The works occupy a large area situated between the railway line and the
      right bank of the river Neckar, midway between Untertürkheim and Esslingen. A.E.G. Bad Cannstatt (3) The Stuttgart works of the A.E.G. produce mainly electrical tools, generators for water turbines, electrical motors of all types, switchboard
      gear and transformers. Fr. Hesser Maschinenfabrik Olgastr. (3) The Fr. Hesser Maschinenfabrik A.G., whose works are in Bad Cannstatt, are makers in peacetime of automatic packing, folding, weighing and labelling machines. A large proportion of

      in Obertürkheim and prior to the war made boilers for steam engines and locomotives. It is now reported that they are concentrating on plate for armoured vehicles and are working in conjunction with the Daimler-Benz concern. M. Streicher
      Linderstr. Bad Cannstatt (3) This firm manufactures municipal vehicles, including road-sweeping, washing and sprinkling machines, and refuse-collecting vehicles. Mahle K.G. a) Bad Cannstatt (2) b) Waiblingen (3) c) Fellbach (3) The Mahle K.G., with which
      the Stuttgart branch of the Elektronmetall G.m.b.H is amalgamated, are among the leading German makers of under-carriages, brakes, wheels, pistons and other components for aircraft and aero-engines. They are believed to supply a large percentage of
      the total German requirements. Other products made by this firm on a large scale are bomb components, fuze bodies, components for incendiary projectiles etc. Some 3,000 workers are engaged in the above three plants. The factories at Waiblingen and

      Inn, which are as follows: Trostberg (2 MW), Tacherting (8 MW), Margarethenberg (17 MW), and Holzfeld (35 MW). Trostberg and Tacherting are owned by Bayerische Stickstoffwerke A.G.; Margarethenberg by Bayerische Kraftwerke A.G.; and Holzfeld by
      Alzwerke G.m.b.H., Munich. These stations utilise the water power of the River Alz along a 20-mile stretch from Trostberg to Holzfeld near the influx of the Alz into the Inn. A diversionary canal 5 miles in length is cut from near Margarethenberg to
      Holzfeld. These power stations serve the various carbide/cyanamide plants in this area. The Holzfeld station serves the plant at Burghausen, which is described under the latter heading, and the plant at Steiner am Hart, which is described under the
      heading "Mühldorf". The Margarethenberg station serves the Steiner am Hart and Trostberg plants. The Tacherting and Trostberg stations serve the plants at Schalchen and Trostberg. The stations are interconnected by a high-voltage transmission

      Arado Tutow (1) The Arado Flugzeugwerke G.m.b.H., the parent works of which are in Brandenburg an der Havel, have a large assembly plant at Tutow. It was originally a repair and testing station, and is believed to have been
      inactive during part of 1943, probably for the purpose of conversion of many of the existing installations. In the course of 1943 the final assembly of FW. 190's was taken up and has since reached a considerable scale. After damage to the Arado
      components factories at Warnemünde and Anklam, it is believed that Tutow has taken over part of the work formerly done at Marienburg. Components are probably drawn from Kreising and Posen, which formerly supplied Marienburg, as well as from the
      reconstructed plants at Warnemünde and Anklam. Aero-engines are imported from Berlin.

      Ulm is the second largest town in Württemberg. It lies on the left bank of the Danube and on the main railway line from Stuttgart to Augsburg and Munich. It is the junction for an important branch line leading South to Friedrichshafen, and for three
      minor branch lines serving the surrounding district. The central area of the town is dominated by the famous "Münster" which is believed to be the largest Gothic Cathedral in the world; its steeple is 528 feet high and it is thus the highest steeple
      in Europe. The most important industrial undertaking in Ulm is the Magirus A.G. This firm specialises in fire-fighting equipment, but has now also attained a high degree of importance as a producer of A.F.V's and heavy armoured vehicles. There is a
      non-ferrous metal fabricating plant, which is described below, and several other engineering works, some of which are working exclusively for Magirus. There is also a small textile and leather industry. The Messerschmitt aircraft assembly works at
      Leipheim 10 miles east of Ulm, are included in the list given below.

      Railway Centre Ulm (2) The main railway line from Stuttgart enters Ulm from the North-east and, after curving Southwards, passes through the main railway station, which is on the western side of the central city area, crosses the Danube and leads in
      an easterly direction to Augsburg and Munich. A branch line from Sigmaringen and South-western Württemberg enters the city area from the North-west and joins the Stuttgart line immediately north of the main railway station. The direct line from Ulm
      to Friedrichshafen diverges from the Munich route between the main station and the railway bridge and leads south-westwards along the left lead from Ulm North-east to Heidenheim and South along the River Ille to Memmingen. Marshalling Yards Ulm (3)
      The chief marshalling yards are to the North-west of the main railway station and inside the main curve made by the railway line from Sigmaringen before it enters the central city area. They are capable of handling up to 2,400 wagons per 24 hours.
      There is a large goods station adjacent to these marshalling yards and a second smaller goods station half a mile to the East alongside the line to Stuttgart. Railway Repair Shops Ulm (3) The railway repair shops, which are at the Eastern end of the
      marshalling yards,

      Magirus Werke Ulm (Werk 1) (2) Ulm (Werk II) (2) Ulm (Werk III) (2) The Magirus Werke are, together with Metz of Karlsruhe, the chief German specialists in fire-fighting vehicles, ladders and heavy and auxiliary equipment. In 1936 the firm was taken over
      by the Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz concern and the former Magirus company was liquidated. It is, however, still usual to refer to the works in Ulm as the Magirus Werke. In addition to their normal fire-fighting equipment, they are now believed to have
      taken up the production of A.F.V's or tanks on a large scale, and a number of reports indicate that Magirus has become a highly important supplier of heavy armaments. Magirus have two works in Ulm proper (Werk I and Werk II)and a third large plant has
      now been established in Neu Ulm, the quarter of the town which lies on the right bank of the Danube. The works referred to as Werk I are in the Schillerstrasse close to the railway bridge across the Danube. The second works are in the
      Blaubeurenstrasse in the Western suburb of Söflingen. They occupy a large area South of the Western end of the marshalling yards and are bisected by the small stream know as the Blau which flows through the town and into the Danube near the railway

      thought probable that these two original works (Werk I and Werk II) are still mainly engaged on the production of fire-engines and equipment, particularly in view of the severe damage to Metz of Karlsruhe, and that the A.F.V's or tank production is
      carried out mainly by the new works in the Neu Ulm area. One report, however, indicates thatsome of the tanks are assembled at Werk II. Other products of this Ulm factory are reported to be Diesel engines, lorries, light transport-column vehicles,
      tractors, smoke-screen devices, propellers and shafts and other components for midget submarines. Reports suggest that in 1945 chenillettes, small tracked vehicles for reconnaissance, were being turned out. Reports state that up to 1944 the new works
      mainly built semi-tracked armoured cars, but that the serial production of tanks was expected to begin shortly. The number of workers employed by Marigus has been variously reported, and is certainly well over 15,000 in total. Ulmer Schraubenfabrik
      Blaubeurenstr. (3) The Ulmer Schraubenfabrik Fervor (Max Sternweiler and K. Rauch) are manufacturers of screws, and are now reported to be working entirely for the Magirus concern. Their works are close to the Magirus Werk II. Karl Kässbohrer Ulm (3) The firm of Karl

    </Description>
    <Public_Utility_Services>
      Hydro Scheme Walchensee (1) The Walchensee hydro scheme, which was built in 1924, uses the water power of the Walchen See and the Kochel See, one mile to the North. There is a 670 ft. head between these two lakes. The natural inflow of the Walchen
      See is augmented by obstructing part of the water of the river Isar by means of a diversionary canal from Krünn 6 miles South of Walchensee to the Southwestern corner of the lake. Between the two lakes the water flows for 3/4 mile through a tunnel. The
      penstock leading into the Kochel See is 1,430 ft long and comprises 6 pipe lines tapering in diameter from 7 1/2 ft. at the top to 6 ft. at the bottom. The installed capacity of this hydro-electric station is 124 MW. It contains special generating plant
      for supply to the German State Railways, as well as plant for general supply. Water supply is at a maximum in spring, when the snow melts, and at a minimum during the frosts of winter.

    <Public_Utility_Services>
      Hydro Scheme Waldeck (1) This electric power scheme is based on the damming of the River Eder, an undertaking which was first put into operation in 1914. The dam near Waldeck impounds 202 million tons of water in the Edersee, and serves three main
      purposes, namely: to store water for improving navigation on the River Weser, to control flood waters, and to supply power for electricity. There are 4 generating stations. The Hemfurth I station near the Edersee dam has a capacity of 14 MW. Hemfurth
      II, one mile downstream, which is equipped with pumped-storage plan, has a capacity of 18 MW. To compensate for the irregular flow through the turbines of the two Hemfurth stations,
      <pb n="695" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454857"/>
      a weir, the Affoldern, 3 miles downstream, has been built to create a compensating reservoir. The generating station at Affoldern has a capacity of 3 MW. Finally, in 1933, a large pumped-storage station was built on the bank of the Affoldern
      compensating reservoir which was used as a lower reservoir, the upper reservoir being artificially constructed on the flat top of the Peterskopf Mountain in the Bringhausen Forest. This generating station, known as the Bringhausen station, has a
      capacity of 120 MW and is used for meeting peak loads and emergencies. The Bringhausen pumped-storage system is one of the largest of its kind. The upper reservoir is 980 feet above the generating station, and has an effective water content of 760,000
      tons. The penstock consists of two parallel pipes 3,150 feet long, tapering in diameter from 8 feet at the top to 7 feet at the bottom. There is an adjoining table railway. The Eder dam was breached by air attack in May 1943 and the reservoir largely
      depleted of water, while the power stations escaped serious damage. The reservoir has since been drained as part of the reconstruction work now in progress.</Public_Utility_Services>

      Anorgana Waldenburg (-) A chemical plant employing the N.E.C. process was erected at Waldenburg by the Furst von Pless mining administration (now known as the Waldenburger Bergwerks A.G.) to utilise their surplus coke-oven gas. The original capacity
      of this plant was 23,000 tons of nitrogen per annum. These chemical works, which were renamed the Anorgana Chemische Handelsges., were purchased in 1932 by the I.G. Farben and the Deutsche Ammoniak Verkaufs-Vereinigung, and the plant was closed down.
      It may now have resumed production.

    <Description>
      Waldshut lies on the Upper Rhine close to the Swiss border, approximately halfway between Schaffhausen and Basle. Waldshut occupies a central position in the chain of electric power stations which form the Upper Rhine hydro scheme. A second hydro
      scheme utilises the water of the Schluchsee, which lies 12 miles North of Waldshut. Both these electric power stations are described below under Public Utilities.
    </Description>
    <Public_Utility_Services>
      Hydro Scheme Upper Rhine (1) The Upper Rhine hydro scheme utilises the water-power resources of a 90-miles stretch of the River Rhine between the Schaffhausen Rhine falls and Basle. This scheme embraces a system of 15 hydro electric power stations
      of which some are under Swiss control. Waldshut lies geographically in the centre of this chain of stations. The German-controlled stations are Rheinau (35 MW), Eglisau (35 MW), Reckingen (36 MW), Waldshut-Kadelburg (37 MW), Albbruck-Dogern (72
      MW), Laufenburg (68 MW), Säckingen (45-75 MW), Riburg-Schwörstadt (104 MW), Rheinfelden (65 MW), and Augst-Wyhlen (51 MW). The Swiss-controlled stations are Schaffhausen (16 MW), Rheinfall (100 MW), Beznau (25 MW), Klingnau (35 MW), and Birsfelden
      near Basle (50 MW). Special features of this hydro scheme are the unusually constant flow of Lake Constance, and the fact that the maximum flow is in July, and the minimum in February, owing to the freezing in winter of the high Alpine water sources
      which feed this part of the river. It is thus possible to maintain a high electrical output all the year round, with a maximum value in summer, when most other hydro schemes are obliged to operate with reduced output.
      <pb n="698" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454860"/>
      The scheme has been jointly developed by the German and Swiss Governments. The total installed capacity is 447 MW, of which the German share is 224 and the Swiss 223 MW. Hydro Scheme Schluchsee (1) The Schluchsee hydro scheme in the Black Forest is
      designed for an ultimate capacity of approximately 400 MW. When fully developed it will use the 1,970 ft. head between the Schluchsee lake and the River Rhine at Waldshut, a distance of 12 miles. The work was planned in three stages. Stage one
      included the damming of the Schluchsee, creation of a reservoir of 108 million tons capacity, and the building of a pumped-storage station at Häusern for a head of 660 ft. Stage two was the building of a pumped-storage station at Witznau for a
      head of 930 ft. Stage three, which is still projected, is the building of a pumped-storage station at Waldshut for a head of 380 ft. Below Häusern and Witznau generating stations there are two reservoirs of 1.3 and 4.5 million tons capacity
      respectively, to serve as daily and weekly storage basins. In 1929 construction was begun on the first stage (Hausern) and on a provisional compensating station at Eichholz. This work was completed in 1933, the installed capacity of the generating
      plant at Hausern being 104 MW. and at Eichholz 30 MW. In 1938 construction was begun on the second stage (Witznau), the intention being to close down Eichholz when this was completed. It is believed that this work was finished in 1942, the installed
      capacity of the generating plant at Witznau being approximately 176 MW, and the total for the scheme as then developed 280 MW. The scheme provides for maximum output in the winter months, and is designed to compensate for the reduced output of the
      Upper Rhine stations when the Alpine water supplies are frozen. The projected pumped-storage station, which has yet to be built at Waldshut, is planned to have a capacity of 100 MW. Substation Tiengen (-) The precise position of this important sub-
      station is unknown. It is the main collecting point for the surplus output of the Upper Rhine and Schluchsee water-power scheme, and is also the terminus of the 380/220 kV long-distance line connecting the hydro-electric stations of the Upper Rhine
      and Vorarlberg to the Ruhr industrial area via Herbertingen, Hoheneck, Rheinau, Kelsterbach, Koblenz, and Brauweiler substations, a distance by this route of 360 miles. Three 110 kV lines connect to Albbruck-Dogern, and two connect possibly to
      Klingau, two to Häusern power station, and two possibly to Berau switching station.

      Wolff and Co Bömlitz (2) This factory is operated by Wolff and Co. K.G. a subsidiary of the I.G. Farben concern. It produced nitro-cellulose during the 1914-1918 war (at the rate of 369 tons monthly) and was allowed to
      continue the manufacture of explosives, concentrating on the production of smokeless powder. From 1938 onwards considerable extensions have been made to the plant and to the number of persons employed there. A variety of reliable reports puts the
      1943 pay-roll at between 13,000 and 15,000. On the assumption that this is primarily a propellant-powder plant, a production of about 40,000 tons a year is indicated. The factory is situated at Bömlitz, 5 miles N.N.E. of Walsrode.

      Wilhelmshaven lies on the North Sea coast at the mouth of the small river Jade which flows into the sea a few miles West of the Weser. It is 40 miles North-west of Bremen and is at the end of a branch railway from Bremen via Oldenburg. It is the Eastern
      terminus of the Ems-Jade Canal and thus has access to the Dortmund-Ems Canal system. Wilhelmshaven is one of Germany's largest naval bases and is the headquarters of the North Sea Western Group and North Sea Coastal Defence Commands. The naval
      shipbuilding yards of Wilhelmshaven (the Kriegsmarine Werft) have built many famous German warships, including the 35,000 ton battle-cruiser Tirpitz. In the past few years, however, the port has chiefly concentrated on the building of submarines, mainly
      of the 500-ton class. The yards at Wilhelmshaven also undertake the repair and maintenance of E-boats and other light craft of a similar type. There are a number of oil-storage depots without the port area, described below under Liquid Fuels, but apart
      from the one firm listed under Engineering and Armaments, Wilhelmshaven contains no other industries of importance.

      Port Area Wilhelmshaven (2) Wilhelmshaven has an extensive system of docks which extend for 5 miles along the Northern shore of the Jade Busen, the large bay at the mouth of the river Jade. These docks are all enclosed and are entered through three
      lock gates at the Eastern end. The dock system is in course of expansion to the Northwards. The yards of the Kriegsmarine Werft are situated in the Bau-Hafen which lies to the East of the town. It is the innermost of the harbours and has access to the
      sea via the Ausrüstungshafen. The Grosser-Hafen is the chief coaling and commercial port and lies immediately South of the town. It includes extensive quay and loading facilities, oil-storage plants, and rail sidings. Immediately to the West is the
      Zwischen-Hafen which contains one large and two small floating docks. The main coal-loading quays are in the Zwischen-Hafen. Further West is the West-Hafen which includes the yards of the Deutsche Werke A.G. On the long sea-wall which divides the
      main docks from the Jade Busen are a number of oil-storage installations and the seaplane base which is mentioned below under "Aircraft and Aero Engines". The Ems-Jade Canal enters the port from the West, passes through the Kanal-Hafen (a channel
      with loading facilities which extends along the landward side of the dock system), and terminates in the Grosser-Hafen. In the last few years reclamation work has been in progress immediately to the North-east, of the main port area where the
      coastline curves round to the Northward and it is reported that a new dock, outer port, and other harbour installations are in process of construction.

      Kriegsmarine Werft Bau-Hafen (1+) The yards of the Kriegsmarine Werft are at the Western end of the Bau-Hafen. Before the war this highly-important shipbuilding centre was one of the principal naval yards for the construction of the German capital
      ships. Among many famous vessels built in these yards were the 35,000 ton battle-cruiser "Tirpitz", sister ship of the "Bismarck", the 26,000 ton battle-cruiser "Scharnhorst", and the two 10,000 ton pocket-battleships "Graf Spee” and "Admiral Scheer".
      Since the outbreak of war the Marine Werft has been almost completely turned over to the production of submarines, chiefly of the 500-ton class. There are six graving docks, of between 360 and 630 feet long, and two building slipways of 500 feet
      length. The yards are capable of building up to 12 submarines simultaneously. In September 1943 11 U-boats were reported as under construction and two submarines afloat and fitting out. The workshops serving these ships lie along the Western and
      Southern sides
      <pb n="726" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454888"/>
      of the Bau-Hafen. The yards, which also include two large floating cranes, are extensively served by rail sidings and have their own power supply described above under "Public Utilities." In 1941 ten thousand workers were employed in
      these yards and this figure is believed to have increased to approximately 12,000 by the end of 1942. Deutsche Werke A.G. West-Hafen (2) The shipbuilding yards known as the Deutsche Werke A.G. are on a small scale compared with the Kriegsmarine
      Werft but have been extended and modernised since the war. They are now mainly used for the repair and servicing of E-boats and submarines. Commercial Dockyard Zwischen-Hafen (2) The Zwischen-Hafen contains three floating docks, of which the
      largest is of 15,000 tons. On the quays surrounding this basin there are a number of commercial shipyards which are now devoted to naval purposes and carry out mainly the repair and servicing of destroyers, torpedo-boats, submarines and naval
      auxiliaries.

      Herdecke Hydro Scheme (N/A) The Herdecke hydro scheme is based upon the Hengsteysee, an artificial reservoir created by damming the river Ruhr below its confluence with the Lenne, and consists of 3 hydro-electric stations and an important
      substation. The scheme has an installed capacity of 146 MW. and is owned by the Rheinisch-Westfalisches Elektrizitatswerk A.G. (RWE.) Essen. Hengstey I and II Power Stations. Hengsteysee (3) These two power stations are part of the Herdecke Hydro
      scheme. Hengstey I, a flow station of 3 MW. capacity, is on the weir at the end of the reservoir. Hengstey II, a similar station also of 3 MW. capacity, is on the river Ruhr a mile below Hengstey I, from which it is controlled. Both stations are of
      local importance only. Koepchenwerk Hengsteysee (1) This is the third and by far the most important of the stations which comprise the Herdecke hydro scheme. The Koepchenwerk is a pumped-storage station of 140 MW. capacity; it is situated on the
      North bank of the Hengsteysee, 6 miles E.S.E. of Witten. 540 feet above the station is the upper storage reservoir, a smaller reservoir which is filled with water from the lower reservoir by pumps situated in the generator hall below. Four large
      pipe lines arranged in pairs connect the upper reservoir with the station; these made a conspicuous landmark but since the war have been heavily camouflaged.
      <pb n="729" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454891"/>
      In the power house are 4 turbines, 4 alternators, and 4 pumps. During low-consumption periods on the R.W.E grid, the punps, operated by the alternators, replenish the upper reservoir. The station is for peak load and emergency use; its great
      importance lies in that when the upper reservoir is full, it can produce up to 140 MW. almost instantaneously. Substation (1) The substation is adjacent to the power station; it has been developed since the war into a key switching station for the
      Ruhr industrial area, second in importance only to Brauweiler. The station was designed for eight 220-kV lines and two 110-kV lines. Single-circuit 220-kV lines go to Leithe via Hattingen, Gersteinwerk (Stockum), Brauweiler, Kruckel; double-circuit lines
      to Letmathe and Kreuztal. No definite information is available about the 110-kV lines; connections possibly go to the Cunowerk and Hattingen stations. Cunowerk Power Station Harkortsee (2) The Cunowerk thermal power station - named after a director of
      the owning company - is situated 3 miles South-east of Witten, on the Harkortsee, a reservoir on the river Ruhr; it is owned by the Kommunales Elektrizitätswerk Mark A.G. Hagen, and has an installed capacity of 85 MW. It is also known as the Herdecke
      thermal power station. It is a base-load station and has been considerably extended since it was opened in 1908. A heat-supply system is associated with the station. An open-air substation, with a number cf 10/50 kV and other transformers and switches
      is situated in the western area of the works. Long-distance supplies may be given at 100 kV via the Koepchenwerk station (see above), 2 miles to the East. 3 lines at 50 kV connect to Gevelsberg and Schwerte, and via Schalksmuhle to the Elversingen
      station, 16 miles to the South-east, which is also owned by the company. Local supplies at 10 kV are believed to be given, including a supply to the Accumulatorenfabrik Hagen A.G. 3 miles to the South-east. R.W.E. Power Station Kruckel (3) Owned by
      Rheinisch-Westfalisches Elektrizitätswerk A.G. the power station is situated 3 miles North-east of Witten. It has an installed capacity of 41 MW. and contains a substation for 10/50 kV. It serves the surrounding industrial area.

      Sprengstoff A.G. Reinsdorf (2) This factory is operated by the Westfälische Anhaltische Sprengstoff A.G. During the last war it manufactured almost the whole range of military explosives, including T.N.T., nitrocellulose, picric acid,
      nitroglycerine, dynamite, and propellant powders. There is a certain amount of ground information regarding its present activities, which is fortunately supplemented by excellent air photographs, dated May, 1943.

      The present lay-out of the plant agrees reasonably well with its ground plan at the end of the last war, with the significant difference that the T.N.T. manufacturing unit has been removed. The nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine plants do not appear
      to have been much altered, and there appears to be some capacity for the manufacture of finished propellant powders. In 1938 it was reported that the Reinsdorf factory produced 15,000 tons of nitro-cellulose per annum, which is a little below the
      estimate of capacity made by the Armistice Commission in 1919. Examination of air photographs taken in May, 1943, suggests that the nitrocellulose capacity might be about 25,000 tons per annum at the present time. Nitroglycerine, or
      diglycoldinitrate, plant appears to be installed, and the capacity may be very roughly estimated at about 6,000 tons per annum.

      in making explosive charge for rocket projectiles.

      lines pass through the town from Frankfort/Main to Nuremburg, and from North Germany to Stuttgart. The main railway station and goods yards are to the North of the central area of the town, which is a closely-built area enclosed by a belt of gardens
      which have taken the place of the former city walls. North-west and North-east of the central area are large barracks, which up to the outbreak of war were occupied by armoured and motorised divisions. Würzburg is in the midst of a large agricultural
      district, and is an important flour-milling centre, the industry being in the hands of a number of medium-sized undertakings. Wine and fruit are largely grown in Franconia, and Würzburg has also three large breweries which did a big export trade in
      peace-time. The other industries are varied, and although none of the individual firms is large, engineering, textiles, varnish and dye manufacture, and furniture-making are all represented and in the aggregate give Würzburg considerable industrial
      importance. The industries are mainly grouped in the northern and eastern quarters of the town. West of Würzburg there is an important link station on the 110 kV transmission line between the Bayernwerk and the R.W.E. There is also a small inland
      harbour on the northern side of the town on the river Main.
