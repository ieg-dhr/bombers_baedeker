LEIPZIG (Saxony) 51° 20» N. 12° 20» E: 5¥> miles: (720,000) Leipzig is the largest town in Saxony. It is highly industrialised, particularly in textiles and. engineering. Prior to the war the famous Leipzig Trade Fair draw a large conmercial public from all parts of the world. Leipzig* s main railway station is the largest in Europe. The Supreme Courts of Law of the Reich are established in the city and Leipzig is also the centre of the German publishing industry. Railway lines radiate from the city in all directions, and there are extensive marshalling yards which form an inportant base for the traffic to the Eastern Front. Leipzig’s industries have been devel­ oped chiefly on the outskirts of the town ani can be divided into two main groups. The first extends from the main station to the North East and South of the city. This area contains several important engineering plants, spinning and weaving mills, and the Northern power station. The second industrial group is on the Western outskirts.
This district includes some of the largest wool and cotton spinning mills in Europe and a number of big engineering works. During the war important aircraft assembly plants have been established on the airfield at Mochau on the North-eastern edge of the town area. The city also contains a number of chemical works, mostly engaged on the manufacture of soap and dyestuffs.

It is situated on the brown-coal deposits at Böhlen, 11 miles S. of Leipzig, and is part of a large industrial complex which includes, besides the power station, a synthetic-oil plant (described below under Liquid Fuels), a low temperature carbonisation plant, (described below under Solid Fuels), and a gas-works (described below). The station is operated on base load and supplies current to the grid system and the city of Leipzig and is also the source of power to the synthetic-oil plant, whose estimated maximum demand is 75 MW with an annual consumption of over 500 million kWh.
Five long-distance double-circuit 110 kV lines run to Chemnitz, Gossnitz, Zeitz, Lausen, and Leipzig respectively and another probably connects with the neighbouring double station of Espenhain- Molbis. Local 30 kV supplies connect to Leipzig by underground cables and at lower voltages to neighbouring industrial works.
Gasworks Bohlen (3) The gas works is part of the ASW complex at BShlen and was erected in 1939 by the Company for the supply of domestic gas to Leipzig and the surrounding district. It operates the Luigi complete-gasification process, using brown coal. Capacity is belived to be about 5,000 million cu.ft. per annum.

It is a double station with duplicate generating plants 250 yards apart arranged opposite and parallel to each other.
There is one switching and transformer station common to both sections, and it is assumed that a large part of the electrical output is supplied to the nearby industrial plant, to which steam is also supplied. The station was under construction at the beginning of the war and details are therefore incomplete.
There are at least 4 long-distance overhead transmission lines, 2 running South-east (possibly one to Dresden and one to Chemnitz), one North-east (possibly to Leipzig), and one West (possibly to Böhlen).
Power Station Kulkwitz (2) This thermal power station is owned by the Landkraftwerke Leipzig A.G. Kulkwitz, and is situated on the brown coal fields 6 miles South-west of Leipzig. It is an old station, and up to 1938 was only of local importance, with an installed capacity of 30 W . Since that year it has been considerably extended and its capacity increased to 105 MW. It is probable that the station now gives additional supplies to nearby industrial works and to the city of Leipzig, and also to the high-voltage grid of the A.G. Sächsische Werke.
StÄdt, Gaswerke Leipzig (2) The municipal gasworks is the principal distributing station on the Thuringian gas grid. It now obtains all its supplies from the Böhlen gasworks (see above). In 1936, the works made 1 ,950 million cu. ft. of gas and purchased for re-sale a further 90 million cu. ft.

LEVERKUSEN (Rhineland) (incl* Schlebusch) 51° N. 7° E: 310 miles: (50,000) Leverkusen is on the right bank of the Rhine 5 miles North of Köln. The industry is almost entirely concerned with the large chemical works described below, which are immediately to the South of Leverkusen and occupy an area almost as large as the town itself.

Electric Power Station Leverkusen (2) The thermal power station forms part of the chemical works of the I.G. Farben and has an installed capacity of 100 MW.
The station supplies both electricity and steam to the works, which utilise the whole of the plant's production. It is not known whether the station is connected to the grid.
Chemicals and Explosives
I.G.Falbenindustrie A.G. Leverkusen (1+) The Leverkusen Works of the I.G. concern ^ere formerly known as Friedrich Bayer & Co. and are still frequently referred . to as the Bayer Works. The plant, which is responsible for a high proportion of the total German production of a number of important chemical products, is of very considerable importance in the German chemical industry.

The heavy-chemical plant at Leverkusen co n sists prim arily o f the sulphuric-acid u n it, which i s estimated to have a capacity o f tons per year or roughly 11% of the to ta l German ca p a city. I t i s the la rg est German sulphuric-acid u n it. The plant is also an important producer o f e le c tr o ly tic ca u stic soda and chlorine» Leverkusen is also one of the la rg est German fa cto rie s making dyes and associated products.« .Among other preparations made here on a large sca le are film base, film s, photographic paper, f i l t e r s and photographic chemicals. The works includes a synthetic- rubber plant producing ”Perdurine” rubber, estim ated to have a capacity o f 4,000 tons per annum. Several, apparently re lia b le , reports indicate that to x ic acids and smoke­ producing compounds are prepared at Lever­ kusen. • I t i s probable that the f i l l i n g process would be carried out in one o f the several f i l l i n g statio n s Situated w ithin the Cologne area. Situated w ithin the works is the plant of the Titanium G.m.b.H., one of the leading German producers of titanium pignents.
I t is believed that the Leverkusen works employs more than 20,000 people. The works, which extend fo r over one mile along the riv e r front,occupies the whole area between the riv e r and the North-to-South railway along the righ t bank o f the Rhine, which here runs p a r a lle l with, and approximately 1,100 yards from, the riv e r. The works has extensive r a il sid in gs, r a i l storage depots, and large harbour f a c i l i t i e s .
Dynamit A.G./
LSVERKUSEN (contd.) Dynamit A.G. Schlebusch (2) This factoiy was of considerable importance in the last war. In 1918 it was one of the most important T.N.T. factories in Germany and produced more than 1,000 tons per month.
It was one of the few factories permitted to continue the manufacture of T.N.T. under the Versailles Treaty and was produc­ ing 294 tons monthly in 1923.
Both ground reports and air photographs suggest that the factoiy has returned at least to its full former level of activity, and certain extensions appear to have been made. The factory has not only its own nitric-acid plant (as is common practice in large explosives factories), but also its own sulphuric-acid plant using the contact process, which is unusual. It is apparent that T.N.T. is still the chi©** product of the plant, capacity being probably about 15,000 tons per annum. It is clear that other explosives are also made at Schlebusch but it is not certain what these are. It almost certainly has plant for the manufacture of nitroglycerine, which may now be used for the production of diglycoldinitrate. In the last war the factoiy produced a small quantity of hexanitrodiphenyl-sulphide, and although this explosive does not now appear to be used by the German forces the plant would be suit­ able for the manufacture of hexanitrodiphenylamine.

MAGDEBURG/
MAGDEBURG- (province Saxony) 52° 10* N. 11° 40’ E: 500 miles: (J20,000)
Magdeburg is the largest town in the Prussian Province of Saxony, and contains heavy and general engineering works of the first order, aero-engine works, an explosives factory, and a large synthetic-oil plant. Its position on the River Elbe and on one of the main North to South trade routes of Europe has given it from the earliest times a commercial and industrial importance which it has maintained up to the present day. It is one of the principal traffic centres of Central Germany, and has a railway junction which is second only to Berlin itself with lines radiating N. to Hamburg and Rostock, E. to Berlin and the Baltic ports, S.E. to Leipzig and Czechoslovakia, S. to Halle, Nürnberg and Munich, and W. to Hanover and the Ruhr. The central German Leipzig-Magdeburg lines have been electrified. The main part of the town is on the left bank of the Elbe, and is a closely built-up area. Industries and groups of industries are situated round most of the town’s perimeter. One important group is at Neustadt and Rothensee, on the northern outskirts, but the Grusonwerk of Krupps, which occupies the first place in Magdeburg’s industries, is in Buckau, the southern portion of the town.
There are large marshalling and goods yards both in Rothensee and in Buckau. The Western quarter of the town, which is known as the Wilhelmstadt, and the Eastern suburb of Friedrichstadt, which is on the right bank of the Elbe, contain groups of industries. The Elbe divides into two channels, forming an island which lies between Magdeburg and Friedrichstadt. This island is itself intersected by a third .narrow river channel (the Zoll Elbe) and contains an inland harbour, with warehouses and storage depots.
The Mittelland Canal follows an E. -W. course 6 miles N. of the town, but this important waterways route is broken where it should be carried over the Elbe, due to the failure to complete the aqueduct, and also by the double ship lift at Hohenwarthe mile to the east of the aqueduct. Barges therefore have to negotiate the 40-60 ft. change in level to the river by the Rothensee shiplift, pass down the N. -S. branch canal into the Elbe, and rejoin the Ihle section of the canal by the locks at Niegripp, a distance of some 8 miles by water from the Rothensee shiplift.
The town of Schönebeck, 9 miles to the South of Magdeburg, where there are aircraft, ammunition, and chemical factories, is dealt with separately.
Transpor tat ion
Inland Harbour Magdeburg (2) Magdeburg has extensive inland harbour facilities for the Elbe traffic. The Handelshafen and the Industriehafen, the two largest docks, are at the Northern end of the town close to the industrial areas of Neustadt and Rothensee. There are several smaller docks and loading basins further downstream at Rothensee and connected with the Weser-Elbe Canal by the N. -S. branch canal and the Rothensee shiplift. This is part of the Mittelland Kanal system, which is continued Eastward from the Elbe to link up with the Oder. There is a further large dock known as the Zollhafen on the island formed by the two arms of the Elbe between Magdeburg and the suburb of Friedrichstadt. Magdeburg handles up to 2 million tons of waterborne goods per annum, including grain, sugar beet, vegetables, coal and timber.

Power is supplied to the associated works, and the stations are believed to be connected with the Mannheim generating station either directly or via the Mundenheim sub-station. Half a mile N.W. of the chemical works an outdoor sub-stat ion, apparently designed for 3 transformers each of 40 W . capacity, is under construction. It will be connected to three high voltage lines, with the object probably of providing a means of incorporating the greater part of the electricity requirements of the works in the event of damage to the local generating plant.

Transport at ion M arshalling Yards Sinsen (3) The m arshalling yards at Sinsen, near M arl, are capable of handling up to 2,Q00 wagons per 24 hours.
P u b lic U t ilit ie s Power Station Hüls (2) The thermal power statio n , which forms part of the synthetic rubber works (see under "Rubber and Tyres") is owned by S tein kohlen -E lektrizitftts A .G ., Essen, a subsidiary o f the R.W.E., and is leased to the Chemische Werke Hüls G.m.b.H. The in sta lle d cap acity i s 150 MW. which is probably taken e n tire ly by the rubber p lan t, whose demand is estim ated to be up to 125 MW. and whose annual requirements are about 900 m illion kWh. Steam as w ell as e le c t r i c it y are supplied to the works.
At the pithead o f the adjacent c o llie r y (see under "S o lid R ie ls") is a small sta tio n containing about 10 MW. capacity of generating plan t. A transformer station is situ ated to the South-west o f the main sta tio n . A lin e , probably operated at 110 kv, connects to the 135 MW. statio n at Lünen, possibly v ia Recklinghausen.

Ammoniakwerke Merseburg Leuna (1+) The works of the Ammoniakwerke Merseburg G.m.b.H., which belong to the I,G. Farben concern, adjoin the village of Leuna on its Southern side. The Leunawerke is one of the largest industrial plants in Germary and covers an area of about 1-J- sq.miles, manufacturing ammonia, fertilisers, chemicals, synthetic oil and other products. The production of synthetic petrol was begun here on a large scale in the year 1932, and since that date, both before and during the war, the works have been continually extended. The Bergius hydrogenation process is used for the treatment of brown coal and brown-coal tar. Reports indicate that in 1943 an annual capacity of 600,000 tons of liquid products had been reached. The Leuna Werke output of methanol was estimated in 1943 to be covering three-fourths of Germany’s requirements. A wide range of other synthetic hydrocarbons is also made at Leuna. Some 50,000 workers are engaged at the Leuna works, more than half of this total being women. There are workers’ colonies at Leuna and Merseburg, but a large proportion of the labour travels daily from Halle.

MÖHLDORF (Bavaria) 48° 15* N. 12° 35* E: 620 miles: (8,000) Mühldorf is on the River Inn close to the former Austrian border and. on the railway line from Munich via Braunau to Austria. A number of important industrial undertakings is grouped in the neighbourhood of this town. The VAWAG have an aluminium works 6 miles to the East in the small village of Toging. The administrative headquarters of these works are in Muhldorf itself. The pre-war population as given above has probably been increased owing to the expansion of these works. There is an explosives works at Kraiburg, 6 miles to the South-west, and further upstream on the River Inn. The works, described below, is one of a number of chemical and explosives factories dispersed over this part of Bavaria. Others are dealt with under the headings Alt&tting, Burghausen, and Trostberg. Five miles to the South­ east of Mnhldorf, at the village of Steiner am Hart, on a branch rail­ way leading to Trostberg, there is a large calcium carbide and cynamide works.
The stretch of the River Inn between Wasserburg and Toging, a distance of 25 miles, is utilised for an important hydro-electric scheme.
Public Utility Services Inn-Alz Hydro Scheme Toging (1) n Toging, which is 3 miles East of Muhldorf, contains the largest of a chain of four hydro electric stations, which utilise the water power of the River Inn, and supply electricity to the group of electro-chemical and metallurgical plants situated in this area. This hydro scheme works in conjunction with the generating stations along the valley of the River Alz, a tributary of the Inn. The Alz stations are dealt with separately under the heading Trostberg.
These stations along the Inn valley extend from Wasserburg, 20 miles upstream and South­ west of Muhldorf, to Toging, and include generating stations at Wasserburg (65MW), Teufelsbruck (65MW), Gars (65MW), and Toging (97MW). A lateral canal 15 miles long has been cut parallel with the river from Jettenbach to Toging.
Non-Ferrous Metal Manufacture and Fabrication VAWAG
Toging (1) The works of the Ver. Al minium Werke A. G. is situated at Toging, 3 miles to the East of Mühldorf. The administrative offices are in Muhldorf. The estimated capacity of the plant is 40,000 tons of aluminium per annum.
In 1943 some 12,000 workers were reported to be employed.
MUHLDORF (continued) Chemicals and Explosives
Explosives factory Kraiburg (2) This factory has be&n built during the present war, and there is no reliable information regarding its ownership or its exact location. No photographic cover of the factory exists. Reports state that it is engaged on the manufacture of propellant-powder, both in the form of square flakes and rods.
It is stated that between 18,000 and 20,000 workers were employed in 1942, and that the labour force has subsequently been increased to 40,000. It is probable that the latter figure is somewhat exaggerated, but there seems considerable evidence of the existence here of a very large propellant-powder plant, of which the capacity may be upwards of 30,000 tons of finished powder per annum Bayerische Kraftwerke A. G. Steiner am (3) Hart
A large calcium carbide and cynamide works, which works in conjunction with the similar works at Tacherting near Trostberg, is situated at the village of Steiner am Hart, 5 miles South-east of Muhldorf. This company, which was concerned with the development of the hydro-electric scheme mentioned above, took over the carbide plant at Steiner am Hart from the Bayerische Stickstoffwerke.

In addition to the manufacture of aero-engines, these works also construct motorcycle combinations and various types of military transport. (See also below under Engineering & Armaments).
The aero-engine section manufactures the 14-cylinder radial B.M.W.-801 aero-engine on a considerable scale. There is also still seme production of the 9-cylinder B.M.W.-132.
Research work on new types of engines is also carried out at the Oberwiesenfeld factory.
The plant operates in conjunction with the works at Allach from which it receives a proportion of its components.

Allach (1)
The B.M.W. plant at Allach was erected in 1941 and was designed to undertake the chief part of the serial production of aero-engines for this concern. The capacity was planned to reach 1,000 aero-engines per month, but nothing like this rate of output has ever been achieved and it is now believed that the works is largely engaged on the manufacture of aero-engine components for its own require­ ments and for supply to other B.M.W. factories.
Seven thousand workers are believed to be employed at this plant which also includes a large aero-engine repair department.

REGENSBURG (Bavaria) 49°N. 12° 5* E: 570 miles: (87,000) Regensburg is on the South bank of the Danube 60 miles North of Munich, and is an important railway junction and transhipment port.
The Danube is navigable as far as Regensburg for barges up to 1,000 tons and goods can therefore be carried from the Black Sea and the Balkans up to Regensburg without transhipment. This port is now of part inula r value in view of the large amount of Roumanian oil which is shipped to it up the Danube.
The pre-war industries of Regensburg also included shipbuilding, the manufacture of tiles, drainage pipes and stoneware, and several small engineering works. There are a number of saw-mills, and the inland port handled a large amount of timber. The Regensburg works of the Messerschmitt A.G., have been greatly developed during the war.
The VAWAG have a large alumina works at Schwandorf, 15 miles to the North on the river Nab, which flows into the Danube 3 miles West of Regensburg. These works are described under the heading of Schwandorf.
Transportation Inland Harbour Regensburg (2) The inland harbour is to the East of the town and on the right bank of the Danube. It has been greatly extended in recent years. In addition to • the two original docks, there is now a system of four large docks further to the East opening out of an entrance basin two miles upstream from the town. This inland port is of great importance to the traffic in oil from Roumania, a large proportion of which is transhipped at Regensburg.
Railway Junction Regensburg (3) Two important main railway lines, from Nurnberg eastwards to Passau and Vienna, and from Hof southwards to Munich, meet in Regensburg and, after passing through the railway station, diverge again to the East of the town.

RHKTKB (Westphalia) contd* In peace, time, Rheine was a centre for the textile industry.
To-day, although there are no industries of individual importance, there are firms engaged in metal manufacture, some spinning and weaving of textiles, and a certain amount of repairs to rolling- stock is undertaken.
The population of Rheine has doubled itself since 1925. This is probably due to its excellent transport facilities together with its peace time industrial development.

This assembly plant employs at least 8,000 workers, including a large proportion of foreign workers. Marienehe was the research and development centre and has been responsible for the design of a long series of Heinkel types (bombers, seaplanes, transport types, etc.).
The main type produced is the He.Ill twin-engined bomber which has been in production in successive versions since 1935* The He. 177 heavy bomber has been built in small numbers since 1941» but large-scale assembly has been transferred elsewhere (Oranienburg and Arado, Brandenburg). Marienehe still produces the twin - He.Ill five - engined glider-towing aircraft.
The works are on a large scale with five assembly halls and over 20 separate machine shops. They have been continually expanded during the past few years. Large-scale production of Heinkel types was also from 1937 under­ taken at the Oranienburg subsidiary (He.Ill’s) near Berlin and in 1942-43 at the Schwechat plant near Vienna (He.219 twin-engined dive-bomber and recently He.280 Jet-propelled fighter). A s a result of the April 1942 raid on Rostock the research sections, together with their equipment and the wind tunnel, were moved to Schwechat.

These works, which in peacetime were among the la rg e st motorcar manufacturers in Europe, have been g rea tly expanded during the war, and the pre-war population o f Rüsselsheim, which is given above, w ill now have been much increased.
The Opel works are now la rg e ly engaged on a ir c r a ft component as well as motor transport manufacture and the number o f workers have been reported as high as 2*0,000. The town o f Rüsselsheim is en tirely concerned with the Opel works, and there are no other industries of importance.

Engineering Armaments
Adam Opel A.G. Rüsselsheim These works, occupying a larga site West and South West of Rüsselsheim, with a quay frontage on the South bank of the Main, at one time produced the Opel range of cars and lorries. They were owned by General Motors. Their pre-war output was up to 120,000 units annually, the works having a productive capacity at,the rate of 200,000 units per annum.
In 1935, lorry production was transferred to a new plant at Brandenburg, many of the components continuing to be made at Rüsselsheim, however. At the outbreak of war car production was stopped and a portion of the plant was converted to the manufacture of air-frame components for Junkers 88 a ircra ft. A ircraft propellor reduction gearing for Daimler-Benz aircraft engines was also manufactured.
In addition, large quantities of vehicle spare parts continued to be made, Rüsselsheim being responsible for maintaining the Opel service and repairs organisation, whilst parts were sent to the lo riy producing plant at Brandenburg.
It was reported early in 1943 that Rüsselsheim was to concentrate upon lorry production, and several reports concerning the manufacture of lo rries at this plant have been received. On the other hand, several references to the manufacture of aircraft engines have been received in 1943« In addition, reference has been made to the manufacture of armoured cars, tracked motor cycles, and amphitfous vehicles.
The number of workers has been variously reported and the whole Rüsselsheim complex would appear to employ 20,000 to 25,000 workers including a large number of foreigners.

Transportation Railway Junction Saalfeld (j) The railway line from Halle, which follows the valley of the Saale to Saalfeld and leads thenoe southwards through the Thüringer Wald to Bamberg and Nürnberg, forms one of the chief North to South railway routes. This line is Joined at Saalfeld by a branch line from Gera, and a subsidiary branch line connects Saalfeld with Arnstadt to the North West.
Public Utility Services Hydro Scheme Saale (2) With the primary object of improving the navigation of the river Elbe in dry periods and of preventing flood damage, two large dams have been erected at Bleiloch and Hohenwarte to control the inflow of the Saale, a tributary of the Elbe. These dams and their reservoirs, which impound a water volume almost equal to the annual flow of the Saale, are among the largest in Germany. The water power thus created is used to serve an important hydro scheme. The four generating stations described below are now fully developed, and it is probable that plans exist for further constructions which will greatly increase the output. -Near Saalburg, 20 miles South-east of Saalfeld, is the Bleilooh dam and reservoir and its adjacent Burgkhanrner compensating reservoir. The generating stations of these two have capacities of 40 UW and 5 respectively. A pump­ storage station operates between the two reservoirs. Pour miles South-east of Saalfeld, near the village of Kaulsdorf, is the Hohenwarte dam and reservoir and its adjacent Eichicht compensating reservoir. The generating stations of these two have capacities of 50 and 5 W respectively. A pump-storage station operates between the two reservoir's.

SAARBRÜCKEN (Saar)
49° 15* N. 7° Et 350 miles» (130,000) Saarbrücken is the largest town in the Saar territory and a most important industrial and coal-mining centre* It is near the southern boundary of the Saar area and is on a main railway line which follows the valley of the River Saar to Trier. Saarbrücken is a railway Junction for several branch lines serving the industrial regions of the Saar and of Lorraine.
The coalfields of the Saar Basin, which extend mainly to the North of the town, are among the largest in Europe and, together with the rich iron-ore deposits of Lorraine, they yield raw material for the highly-developed iron and steel industry in these regions. Several iron and steel works are established in Saarbrücken itself. The industries include a number of engineering works which, though individually on a small scale, constitute in the aggregate a valuable factor in the German war production. The industrial area extends along the valley of the River Saar from the outskirts of V 611 ingen (5 miles to the West) to Brebach and Neusohtfidt, 3 mjlcs to the East of Saarbrücken* The river Saar is navigable and is an important means of transport for the products of this region.

SALZGITTER/
SZJLZGITTER (Hanover) 52° O5» N. 10° 32* E: miles: (4,2$0) The great iron ore deposits of S alzgitter just north of Goslar in the Harz region and S.S.W. of Brunswick have been worked on a small scale for many years, and, following the loss of Lorraine in 1919, their large scale operation was discussed by German geologists and m etallurgists. According to a report published in 1934 by the Prussian Geological Institute (Die Eisenerzvorrate des Deutschen Reiches) the size of the deposits of ore that could be worked as an economic proposition was 35 million tons while there was a further 65 million tons of ore that would require more favourable business conditions such as cheap fireight and higher steel prices before it could be considered.
These two categories of ore were at a depth of a few feet to nearly 1,000 feet below the surface, but going to a depth of 3,300 feet at least MX) million tons of ore were available. I t has since been stated that the estimate of volume of ore was much too low. Features common to a ll the Salzgitter ores are their high phosphorus content, which makes them suitable for the basic Bessemer process, and their high silica content, which,, un til the discovery by Brassert of .the means of using acid burdens in blast furnaces, rendered them unsuitable for smelting without the mixture of other ores. The greater part of the Salzgitter ores have an extremely low iron content but among the best grades are some with an iron content of about 4$ per cent. Before the introduction of the Brassert process and the erection of the* Reichswerke Hermann G bring, the best Salzgitter ores were mined to the extent of ä few hundred thousand tons per annum by the nearby Ilseder Hütte of Peine, which mixed them with the limey Peine ores, and by certain Ruhr works which mixed them with imported ores.
Following the successful introduction in the mid-thirties of acid burdening at Corby in Northamptonshire where the ores are also sicilious, the large scale working of S alzgitter ores became a practical proposition provided a works was erected on the spot. In pursuance of its policy of aiming at raw material self-sufficiency the Nazi Government therefore decided to build such a plant and to link i t by a special canal with the Mittelland Canal so as to provide cheap transport to and from the Ruhr. In the barges bringing the necessary coking coal for the works’ own coke ovens it was planned to send back Salzgitter ore to the Ruhr works. Thus, as a result of Government action, conditions were created for the use of S alzgitter ores to an extent far exceeding anything conceived by the Prussian Geological substitute.
There are now a number of iron ore mines in operation in this area.
As already indicated some are of the surface or quarry type and none represent suitable ’’objectives” «

SCHKOPAU (Province Saxony) (Contd.) Public Utility Services
Electric Power Station Schkopau (1) The electric power plant which supplies current to the synthetic-rubber works at Schkopau consists of two generating stations with a combined capacity of 150 MW. The station is owned by the Buna Werke G.m.b. H.
The second generating station was still under construction in 194-2 but is assumed to be now complete. It is probable that most if not all of their combined electrical output is supplied to the rubber plant, the demand of which is probably a minimum of 125 MW with an annual requirement of about 900 million kWh, Steam is probably also supplied to the works, A substation connects the plant to the‘grid at an operating voltage of probably 110 kV, It is probable that one line connects to Gross Kayna and one to Leuna,
Rubber and Tyres Buna Werke Schkopau (1 «►) The Schkopau plant of the Buna Werke G.m.b,H, is the largest of the German synthetic rubber plants, The original experimental works were begun in 1956, and the present factory first went into production in 1939 with a planned fin^l »capacity of 25,000 tons per annum.
Further expansions of the works during the war have increased this capacity to at least 50,000 tons per annum. This exceeds the present estimated. capacity of the Hhls works, the second of the two leading German synthetic rubber plants, which is described under the heading Marl. The Schkopau plant produces' the synthetic rubber from carbide, whereas the Hhls plant operates from methane-ethane gas. At least 20,000 workers are believed to be employed at the Schkopau factory. There are workers1 colonies both at Schkopau and in the neighbouring settlement of Merseburg, and a large proportion of the labour travels daily from Halle,

SCHÖNEBECK/
SCHÖNEBECK (P ro v in c e S axony)
52° N. 11° 45* Es 510 miles: t 36,000) Schönebeck is on the l e f t bank o f the Elbe 9 m iles South of Magdeburg. South of and adjoining Schönebeck is the settlem ent of Bad Salzelmen where there are extensive in s ta lla tio n s fo r curative brine baths. Bad Salzelmen is included in the adm inistrative area o f Schönebeck.
A chemical industry had developed in th is town, which owed its o rigin to the brine deposits in the neighbourhood; th is industry is now making explosives. There is also a large ammunition factory and an aero-engine and a ir c r a ft components works o f the Junkers concern.
A irc ra ft and Aero Engines Junkers Flugzeug & Motorenwerke Schönebeck (2) The Junkers works at Schönebeck occupy a large area to the East o f the town and are believed to be s t i l l in process o f expansion. In January 1944 a number of now buildings were being erected. The plant is engaged on the manufacture and erection o f control columns and engine­ bearings, under-carriages and other a ir c r a ft and aero-engine components. I t s products are supplied mainly to the Junkers works at Bernburg. ffflfitaWKtaK-afia Armagpflts Patronen Zündhütchen Bad Salzelmen (2) The Patronen Zündhütchen & M etallwarenfabrik A .G ., are makers o f ca rtrid g es, percussion caps, detonators, and S.A.A. They have also a section which makes machines and machine to o ls fo r th eir own works. The fa cto ry , in -which at le a s t 2,000 workers are employed occupies a large area to the West of Bad Salzelmen. This company is jo in tly owned by the Dynamit A.G-. and Rheinmetall B orsig.
Chemicals and Explosives Lignose
Bad Salzelmen (2)
This fa cto ry is operated by the Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H. Ground reports have suggested that the output o f T.N.T. at th is plant is very large indeed. Some reports put i t as high a s 60,000 tons per annum. Examination of photographic cover p rio r to the attack on the plant early in 1944 suggests that on the b asis o f the size o f bu ild in gs, e t c ., the T.N.T. capacity may be of the order of 40,000 tons per annum. There are two large T.N.T. manufacturing units which appear to be id e n tic a l, and one sm aller unit o f somewhat d iffere n t layout. Some new construction/
SCHÖNEBECK Province Saxony) (Contd)
construction was then in hand, but it is not yet clear whether this was intended for high- explosives manufacture or not. The photographs suggest that, in addition to T.N.T. amatol is also prepared in this plant by mixing some part of the T.N.T. production with ammonium nitrate. This may be the explanation of the very high figures for T.N.T. output which have been given from some sources.
Ground sources have suggested that there are two factories making explosives at Schbnebeck.
This is not confirmed by air photographs, and it is suggested that the second explosives factory reported is in fact the Patronen Zündhütchen und Metallwarenfabrik, ■which is a fuse-making establishment in the neigh­ bourhood., and which has mounded buildings for the storage of explosives and detonators.
The high-explosives factory lies in open country on rising ground on the south bank of the river Elbe, about 2 km. due west of Schbnebeck railway station, and 1J km. south­ west from the river bank.
Ground reports have stated that shells are also filled in this factory, but air photographs do not confirm this, and it would be very unusual practice to use an explosives factory for filling weapons. It is probable, however, that there is a filling factory in the immediate neighbourhood.
The factory was almost completely destroyed only in 1944, probably as a by-product of the raid of January 21/22, 1944 on Magdeburg.

SCHRAMBERG (Württemberg) 48° 15’ N. 8° 25’ E; 440 miles: (16,000) Schramberg is in the central area of the Black Forest 30 miles North-east of Freiburg. It is at the terminus of a small branch railway from Schiltach which in its turn is connected at Hausach with the main railway line from Offenburg through the Black Forest to Donaueschingen. As with many similar remote towns in the Black Forest, watch and clock making is the traditional industry. In the case of Schramberg, however, the development of the firm of Junghans has given the town outstanding importance in this branch. Apart from a few minor watch makers, the activities of Schramberg are entirely concerned with the Junghans works.
Engineering and Armaments Junghans Schramberg (1) The Gebr. Junghans A.G. Uhrenfabriken are the largest individual firm of watch and clock makers in the Blade Forest area. In peacetime they employed some 5,000 workers and were capable of producing watches and clocks at the rate of 27,000 daily. The parent works of the concern are in Schramberg and include, in addition to the large watch­ making factory, a section devoted to the manufacture of the precision tools required in this industry. A separate saw mill and woodworking factory, also in Schramberg, prepares the wooden casings for the clocks. .
The works has its own hydro-electric power plant. A branch factory in Lehengericht, 5 miles North of Schramberg, makes watch springs. There is a second smaller watch factory in Schwenningen 15 miles to the South East of Schramberg, and a components factory in Rotteriburg JO miles to the North­ east of Schramberg.
The factories in Schramberg, which are now said to number three separate plant?, are believed to employ some 1J,000 workers and^ in addition to a fairly wide range of precision instruments, are now largely turned over to the manufacture of fuzes. /Together
SCHRAMBERG ( conti. ) Junghans (contd.)
Together with the firm Gebr. Thiel df Ruhla in Thuringia, this production of fuzes is reported to amount to 100,000 daily.
There is an apprentices’ school in Schramberg where up to 200 mechanics and watch makers are under training. During the latter half of 1943 the number of foreign workers, which had hitherto been small, was increasing continually, mostly Frenchmen and Ukrainians of both sexes being engaged.
Although the firm’s payroll has increased from 5,000 to 13,000 in the course of the war it is unlikely that the number of workers actually employed in the Junghans factories has increased to any major extent because they were already working to capacity before the war. It is assumed that seme 7,000 to 8,000 workers are employed by sub-contractors or are "home workers’*.

SCHWEINFURT ^Bavaria) 50° 5* N. 10° 15* E: 460 miles: (60,000) Schweinfurt is in the North-western area of Bavaria on the North bank of the River Main, 25 miles North-west of W&rzburg. It is on the railway route from Northern Germany to Stuttgart and on the East to West line from Bamberg to Mainz and the Rhine valley.
The Main is already navigable for heavy barges as far as Aschaffenburg, but it is possible that the project to connect the Main with the Danube has already progressed upstream beyond Schweinfurt, in which case the hitherto small inland harbour will have increased in importance.
Schweinfurt is the largest centre of the German ball bearing industry and normally produces well over half the total requirements.
This manufacture is carried on mainly in four large factories which are grouped round the main railway station on the South-western outskirts of the town. The technical equipment and individual skill required in this industry, on which many engineering and armament branches depend have been developed over a long period and have made Schweinfurt a highly specialised industrial community which it is difficult to transplant or replace.
As a result of several bombing attacks very severe damage has been done to the four principal factories.
Transportation
Inland Harbour Schweinfurt (3) There is a small harbour on the North bank of the River Main in the industrial district of Schweinfurt to the West of the town centre.
This harbour, which is served by railway sidings, is close to the V.K.F. plant.
Until 1939 only the smaller barges could proceed up the Main beyond Aschaffenburg, but it is possible that the Main-Danube canal project is now sufficiently advanced for heavier traffic to reach Schweinfurt and Bamberg.

V .K.F.
When in full production the group of Schweinfurt factories belonging to this concern formed by far the most important unit in the German ball-bearing industry. The V.K.F. group employed at least 10,000 workers. The chief plants are described below. This concern extended its range of production during the war to include taper-roller, barrel-roller and the heaviest types of bearings, V .K.F. Werk I (Schweinfurter Präzisions- Schweinfurt (1)* Kugellagerwerke Fichte1 & Sachs, W&lzlager Abteilung) This factory was purchased from the Schweinfurt firm of Fichtel & Sachs in 1929, In 1938, 3,000 to 3,500 workers were employed. It produced all types of bearing, including the majority of the German output of precision bearings, and concentrated particularly on the finishing and assembling processes, receiving part of its requirements of semi­ products from V.K.F. Werk II and other sources.
V .K.F. Werk II (Deutsche Gusstahlkugel & Schweinfurt (1)M Maschinenfabrik A.G. vorm.
Fries & Hbpf linger) This factory was also acquired in 1929, It produced all types of bearings, and was also engaged in the production of balls and the machining of races for Werk I, where the finishing and final assembly was carried out. 4,500 to 5,0 0 0 workers were employed in 1938, It is believed that the plant has been extended since । the war by taking over neighbouring premises.
In addition to standard varieties of bearing, these two works have also, in recent years, taken up the manufacture of the heaviest types of bearings, as well as taper-roller and barrel-roller bearings. These had formerly been imported from Sweden.
Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.nub.H. Schweinfurt (2)* The section of the V.K.F. concern known as the Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.m.b.H, was before the war engaged exclusively on the production of ball-bearing cages. They supplied these to the other ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt and to the open market. Approximately 1,000 workers were employed.
* The priority ratings are based OQ the pre­ raid value of these objectives.

Schweinfurt (1+)*
The Schweinfurt plant of the Kugelfischer Schoefer A.G. combine is immediately North of the railway line and main station. It is the largest single factory in the German ball bearing industry and produced all types of ball and roller bearings, with the exception of the heaviest industrial bearings, before the war. 5,000 to 6,000 hands were employed in 1938, but figure had risen to 7>000 by 1939* ^he size of the works has been much increased since the outbreak of war. It is, therefore, the largest individual factory in the German ball bearing industry, and reports received prior to the air attacks suggested that as many as 12,000 workers were employed.
Fichtel & Sachs Ernst Sachs (1)* Str.
The ball bearing factory belonging to this firm was taken over by the V.K.F. and is now Werk I of that concern as mentioned above* The firm of Fichtel & Sachs, .though possibly now affiliated with the V.K.F. concern, still retains its identity and continues to operate under its own name. The works make light weight motorcycles, motor boat engines, cycle hubs and other motor vehicle components, including the F & S patent clutch which is widely used in the German motor industry. A limited range of small ball-bearings for use in their own products is produced in the section of the plant retained by Fichtel & Sachs.

SIEGBURG (Rhineland) (Contd.)
among which laminated articles made from bakelite are perhaps the most important, are also made here. It is quite likely that some explosive nitrocellulose is still manufactured here, and indeed this view is supported by the examination of air photographs. It is difficult to estimate what part of the nitrocellulose capacity is available for explosives manufacture.
The total installed capacity represents about 12,000 tons per annum, but the majority of this will certainly be used for plastics manufacture.
The factory is important as being one of the largest producers of detonators in Ge many. It introduced the manufacture of lead azide detonators in aluminium caps.
Even before the war the production of these detonators was running at the rate of about 120 million per annum, and there is little doubt that it has been increased since. The ■ factory prepares its own raw materials for detonators, having a sodium azide plant with an output in excess of 160 tons per annum.
The factory is situated 13 miles south-east of Cologne.

In 1937 the area produced a minimum amount of 1*517,000 tons of iron ore and employed 4,900 workmen. The output was mostly consumed by local blast furnaces though a little found its way to Rhenisch-Westphalia. Siegen is also a Junction for three minor branch lines. It is at the Southern end of a line of industrial settlements which extend, mostly along the valley of the River Lenne, fron Siegen to the vicinity of Hagen, and which contain a large number of rolling mills, wire drawing, and metal working plants, and foundries. Siegen itself has a number of foundries speci a 1, i sing in the production of rollers for steel rolling mills, and is responsible for a high proportion of the German requirements of this essential component.

r» 51 10’ N. 7 05» E: 312 miles: (153,600) The Solingen d istrict lie s across the highland separating the Rhine and the Wupper valleys, and covers a total area of about thirty square miles. It includes the following towns and v illa g es:- (1) Solingen, with a population of 142,000 including Wald, Ohligs, Grafrath and Hbhscheid. (2) Haan, with a population of 11,600 Total 153,600
The city of Solingen it s e lf lie s 740 feet above sea-level in a bend of the river Wupper, about seven miles South of Wuppertal. It is connected by r a il with the great industrial centres of the Ruhr, but is not in it s e lf an important railway centre.
Solingen is known as ’’the Sheffield of Germany” on account of its world-famous light engineering industry which is mainly concerned with the production of cutting machines, tools, knives, scissors, and surgical instruments. Bicycles and components for motor vehicles and small arms are also manufactured.
The suburbs of the city - Wald to the North-west, Ohligs to the West, and Gr&frath. to the North - are also industrialised, and some of the larger engineering plants are to be found in these areas.
The outlying settlements of the Solingen d istrict are, for the most part, non-industrial, with the exception of Haan whose fa ir­ sized engineering works were mainly engaged on the production of cutlery.

I t has d ire ct r a i l communications with B erlin , Frankfurt (Oder), and Danzig, and through the River Oder is joined up to the main North German inland-waterway system. It plays an important part in the seaborne supply arrangements fo r the Eastern Front.
The cen tral area o f S te ttin is a compact mass composed mainly o f dwelling houses and o ffic e s . The in d u stria l area extends along the riv e r from the dock area in the south-eastern quarter of the c ity northwards along the l e f t bank to Gutzlow. Kost of the important in d u stria l plan ts are in th is area.
The main industry of S te ttin i s connected with i t s shipyards.
No large v e sse ls are b u ilt here, but there is considerable a c tiv ity in the building and fittin g -o u t o f submarines, mi ne sweepers, naval escort v e sse ls, and tank landing c r a ft. The shipyard area is in the neighbourhood of Grabow, which i s on the le f t bank of the river one mile to the North of the main railw ay bridge. The Vulkan shipyards have been considerably extended during the war. Opposite the shipbuilding yards is the Bredow Werder, a large island in the channel o f the Oder, which is in process o f being converted into an in d u strial area and naval base. At the South end o f th is island a large dock basin has been excavated. The port or dock area is on the righ t bank of the Oder immediately North o f the marshalling yards, and in the neighbourhood of the docks is a large concentration of warehouses, timber yards, o il depots, and sm all fa c to r ie s .

STUTTGART/
STUTTGART (Württemberg) 48° 45* N. 9° 10* E; 450 miles; (600,000) Stuttgart, the capital of Württemberg, is the most important industrial town in Southern Germany. It lies in a valley surrounded by wooded hills which open out in the East into the valley of the river Neckar, The town has grown in size consider­ ably since the end of the last century, the development being ' due mainly to the engineering industry consisting principally of light and electrical engineering. Together with the adjoining suburb of Zuffenhausen, Feuerbach forms one of the chief industria­ lised quarters of the Stuttgart district. The second industrial area is in Cannstatt and Affinster, which are to the North of the city centre and on the left bank of the river Neckar, This area includes an important ball-bearing works, the town’s electric power station, and several precision-engineering works. A third industrial district is East of the city centre and on the right bank of the river, extending Southeastward from UntertÖrkheim up the river valley to Esslingen. The highly important main plant of the Daimler-Benz concern is in Untertürkheim, which also contains large marshalling yards and railway-repair shops. Halfway between Untertürkheim and Esslingen are the "Index” works of Hahn A Tessky, one of Germany’s leading makers of machine tools.
The manufacture of machine tools and measuring instruments is a highly-developed industry in Stuttgart and also in the neighbouring settlements of Esslingen, 4 miles to the South-east, It is characteristic of Stuttgart, as indeed of the whole of Württemberg, that in normal times industry tends to remain in the hands of a large number of medium-sized or small firms. This is particularly the case with machine tools, and it is, therefore, not possible to include all the numerous firms which in the aggregate make Stuttgart a vital factor in the German engineering industry, Stuttgart is an important railway centre and is on the main routes from the North to Zurich and from Munich to Karlsruhe and France.
Transportation
Railway Centre Stuttgart (2) The main railway station is situated in the centre of the town and is one of the largest terminal railway stations in Germaiy. Stuttgart lies on two important trunk routes, from North Germany to Zurich, and from Munich to Karlsruhe and France, Two branch lines lead East and West to SchwÄbisch-Gmünd and B&blingen respectively, and several minor branches serve the neighbouring industrial settlements, including Sindelfingen, Kornwestheim and Ludwigsburg, Marshalling Yards Untertörkhei« (?)

Power Station Stuttgart (2) This thermal power station is situated in Münster, a northern suburb of Cannstatt.
It is owned by the Stuttgart Corporation and has an installed capacity of 87 MW. In addition to the general town supply, power is delivered for railway traction. There are no important long-distance supplies. '
An adjacent 6/110 kV substation is owned by Elektrizitäts-Versorgung Württemberg A.G. and provides supplies for traction locally and via a 110-kV transmission line through Plochingen to Pasing to serve the electrified Stuttgart-Ulm-Augsburg-Munich railway line (single-phase circuit).
A substation for 3/10 kV transmits supplies locally. Medium-voltage lines connect to Degerloch and Obertürkheim.
Power Station Marbach (2) The Marbach plant consists- of a large thermal station, begun in 1938 and completed since the outbreak of war, and a small hydro station, and has an installed capacity of 108 MW. It is situated on the river Neckar about 10 miles North of Stuttgart and this relatively remote location was probably chosen mainly as an air-raid precaution. It is believed that practically the whole electrical output is supplied to the grid at the 220-kV Hoheneck substation and the 110-kV Obertürkheim sub­ station from whence a part is transmitted to Stuttgart. The small hydro station has an installed capacity of 3 MW.
An outdoor substation contains 4 double-circuit 110-kV lines, of which one, possibly two, connects to Obertüikheim and two to Hoheneck. /Substation
STUTTGART (contd.)
Substation Hoheneck (2) This important substation is situated 2 miles South-west of the Harbach generating station. It is being extended and identification is therefore uncertain. The station is on the 220-kV (planned 380—kV) long-distance line which links the water- power stations of the mountainous regions on the southern frontiers of Germany with the Ruhr industrial area.
There are three adjoining sections for 220 kV? 110 kV and 60 kV respectively.
Each section has duplicate busbars.
Two 380/220-kV circuits connect to Rheinau and two to Herbertingen.

Zuffenhausen (3) The Zuffenhausen worts of this company is mainly engaged on experimental wort, which is carried out on behalf of its holding company, the Heinkel aircraft concern. The research and experimental work is chiefly connected with the development of low- powered aero-engines, aero-engine components, and, in particular, crankshafts.
The Hirth Motoren G.m.b.H. occupies the same site, and works.in close co-operation with the aoove firm. The ground reports suggest that since early 194J0 approximately 1,000 workers have been employed at the Zuffenhausen factory, and there are indications that, in addition to research and experimental work, a small range of aero-engine components manufactured here.

This factory has been considerably enlarged since 1939, and has acquired at least one of the neighbouring factory sites, apai*t frcm erecting two new workshops adjacent to its old premises. It is believed to be engaged mainly on the manufacture of air­ craft components and cylinder-baffling silencers, air filters, and other aero-engine components. Other products of the firm are components for flame throwers, and reports suggest that a number of other firms in Esslingen supply Eberspächer with major and minor components for flame throwers, indicating that assembly of flame throwers is likely to be undertaken by them.
/Daimler-Benz
STUTTGART (contd.)
Daimler-Benz A.G. UntertÜrkheim (1) The principal pre-war activity of this company was the manufacture of motor vehicles, and it is believed that the major part of the very extensive old Daimler-Benz works at Untertürkheim is still employed on work connected with the IJIOtor-vehicle industry.
This aspect of the Daimler-Benz production is dealt with below, under "Engineering and Armaments”, and the following relates exclusively to those pai’ts of the works which are believed to be engaged on aero­ engine work.
For several years prior to the war the Daimler- Benz company undertook the development of aero-engines, and prototypes were built and tested at this works. It is thought that up to 1939 no large-scale production of aero­ engines was undertaken, except at the branch factories at Genshagen and Marienfelde, near Berlin. Reports suggest that these two factories were supplied with components from Untertürkheim. It is not definitely known when the complete construction of aero­ engines at UntertÜrkheim commenced, but it seems probable that it was during the early part of 1942. Up to the end of that year aero-engines erected at Untertürkheim were transported to Sindelfingen for testing, but since then the UntertÜrkheim works has been very greatly extended, and it is clear from reconnaissance photographs that most of the sections are connected with the production of aero-engines, which is now taking place at Stuttgart on a large scale. Several series of engine test-beds have been erected, and it is believed that UntertÜrkheim now represents one of the principal production centres for Daimler-Benz engines.
Engineering and Armaments
Daimler-Benz A.G. UntertÜrkheim (1) Owing to its interests in other industries (particularly the aero-engine industry - see aoove) the Daimler-Benz company is the largest motor-vehicle concern in Germany.
In terms of output the UntertÜrkheim plant is second only to Opel, its 1938 production figures being 20,000 passenger cars and 6,000 commercial .vehicles. There is reason to believe that the manufacture of commercial vehicles, particularly lorries, has increased considerably in the course of the war, and that there has been a corresponding decline in the output of cars, production of which is confined mainly to military types. Several sections of the UntertÜrkheim plant are engaged on the manufacture of components for motor vehicles, which are partly supplied to /their

Stickstoffwerke Trostberg j Stickstoffwerke Schälchen ) The Trostberg plant of the Bayerische Stickstoffwerke A.G-. produces, in conJunction.with the Piesteritz works of this concern, 125,000 tons of nitrogen annually. Calcium cyanamide is also produced, and in 1937 their output of this chemical was 30,000 tons. Formerly some 600 workers were employed in the Trostberg plant, but this number has probably been increased. The Schälchen plant, which is at Tacherting 4 miles North of Trostberg, produces calcium carbide for supply to the Trostberg factory.

ULM (Württemberg)
48° 25’ N. 10° E: 500 miles: (68,000) Ulm is the second largest town in Württemberg. It lies on the left bank of the Danube and on the main railway line fron Stuttgart to Augsburg and Munich. It is the Junction for an important branch line leading South to Friedrichshafen, and for three minor branch lines serving the surrounding district.
The central area of the town is dominated by the famous "Munster” which is believed to be the largest Gothic Cathedral in the world; its steeple is 528 feet high and it is thus the highest steeple in Europe. The most important industrial undertaking in Ulm is the Magirus A.G.
This fiim specialises in fire-fighting equipment, but has now also attained a high degree of importance as a producer of A.F.V‘s and heavy aimoured vehicles. There is a non-ferrous metal fabricating plant, which is described below, and several other engineering works, some of which are working exclusively for Magirus. There is also a small textile and leather industry. The Messerschnitt aircraft assembly works at Leipheim 10 miles east of Ulm, are included in the list given below.
Transportation
Railway Centre Ulm (2) The main railway line from Stuttgart enters Ulm from the North-east and, after curving Southwards, passes through the main railway station, which is on the western side of the central city area, crosses the Danube and leads in an easterly direction to Augsburg and Munich. A branch line from Signaringen and South-western Wurttemberg enters the city area from the North-west and Joins the Stuttgart line immediately north of the main railway station. The direct line from Ulm to Friedrichshafen diverges from the Munich route between the main station and the railway bridge and leads south-westwards along the left lead from Ulm North-east to Heidenheim and South along the River Ilie to Memmingen.

Electric Power Station Ulm (3)
This thermal power station, built by the city of Ulm and now belonging to the Oberschwabusche Elektrizitätswerke A. G., is connected with the grid of the R.W.E. and is believed to have been increased in capacity from 25 MW to 60 MW. It is on the river Blau, a small tributary stream which flows through the city and joins the Danube near the Ulm railway station. An indoor substation connects the station by a 55-kV long-distance line to the RWE substation at Herbertingen for the main purose of importing rather than exporting electricity.
Supplies are given locally to consumers in the Ulm area.

The Magirus Werke are, together with Mets of Karlsruhe, the chief German specialists in fire-fighting vehicles, ladders and heavy and auxiliary equip­ ment. In 1936 the firm was taken over by the Klockner- Humboldt- Deutz concern and the former Magirus company was liquidated. It is, however, still usual to refer to the works in Ulm as the Magirus Werke. In addition to their normal fire-fighting equipment, they are now believed to have taken up the production of A F . V ’s or tanks on a large scale, and A number of reports indicate that Magirus has become a highly important supplier of heavy armaments.
Magirus have two works in Ulm proper (WerkI and Werk II) and a third large plant has now been established in Neu Ulm, the quarter of the town which lies on the right bank of the Danube.
The works referred to as Werk I are in the Schillerstrasse close to the railway bridge across the Danube. The second works are in the Bl^ubeurenstrasse in the Western suburb of Söflingen.
They occupy a large area South of the Western end of the marshalling yards and are bisected by the small stream know as the Blau which flows through the town and into the Danube near the railway bridge.
There are several other factories ( saw mills, roof-felting makers, a rayon mill, and a fertiliser factory) grouped round the Magirus works area. It is /thought.
ULM (continued) Magirus (contd.) thought probable that these two original works (Werk I and Werk II) are still mainly engaged on the production of fire-engines and equipment, particularly in view of the severe damage to Metz of Karls­ ruhe, and that the A.F.V’s or tank production is carried out mainly by the new works in the Neu Ulm area.
One report, however, indicates that some of the tanks are assembled at Werk II. Other products of this Ulm factory are reported to be Diesel engines, lorries, light transport­ column vehicles, tractors, smoke­ screen devices, propellers and shafts and other components for midget submarines. Reports suggest that in 1945 chenillettes, small tracked vehicles for reconnaissance, were being turned out. Reports state that up to 1944 the new works mainly built semi-tracked armoured cars, but that the serial production of tanks was expected to begin shortly.
The number of workers employed by Marigus has been variously reported, and is certainly well over 15,000 in total.

The Swiss- controlled stations are Schaffhausen (16 MW), Rheinfall (100 MW), Beznau (25 W ) , Klingnau (35 MW), and Birsfelden near Basle (50 MW).
Special features of this hydro scheme are the unusually constant flow of Lake Constance, and the fact that the maximum flow is in July, and the minimum in Februa, ry, owing to the freezing in winter of the hi^i Alpine water sources which feed this part of the river. It is thus possible to maintain a high electrical output all the year round, with a maximum value in summer, when most other hydro schemes are obliged to operate with reduced output.
/The
WALDSHUT (contd.)
Hydro Sehen» (contd.)
The scheme has been jointly developed by the German and Swiss Governments • The total installed capacity is 447 MW, of which the German share is 224 and the Swiss 223 MW.
Hydro Scheme Schluchsee (1) The Schluchsee hydro scheme in the Black Forest is designed for an ultimate capacity of approximately 400 MW. When fully developed it will use the 1,970 ft. head between the Schluchsee lake and the River Rhine at Waldshut, a distance of 12 miles. The work was planned in three stages.
Stage one included the damming of the Schluchsee, creation of a reservoir of 108 million tons capacity, and the huildi ng of a pumpedr-storage station at Häusern for a head of 660 ft. Stage two was the building of a pumped-storage station at Witznau for a head of 930 ft. Stage three, which is still projected, is the building of a pumped- storage station at Waldshut for a head of 380 ft. Below Häusern and Witznau generating stations there are two reservoirs of 1,3 and 4,5 million tons capacity respectively, to . serve as daily and weekly storage basins.
In 1929 construction was begun on the first stage (Hausern) and on a provisional compensat­ ing station at Eichholz. This work was completed in 1933, the installed capacity of the generating plant at Hauserh being 104 MW. and at Eichholz 30 MW. In 1938 construction was begun on the second stage (Witznau), the intention being to close down Eichholz when this was completed. It is believed that this work was finished in 1942, the installed capacity of the generating plant at Witznau being approximately 176 MW, and the total for the scheme as then developed 280 MW. The scheme provides for maximum output in the winter months, and is designed to compensate for the reduced output of the Upper Rhine stations when the Alpine water supplies are frozen. The projected pumped-storage station, which has yet to be built at Waldshut, is planned to have a capacity of 100 MW.
Substation Tiengen (-) The precise position of this important sub­ station is unknown. It is the main collecting point for the surplus output of the Upper Rhine and Schluchsee water-power scheme, and is also the terminus of the 380/220 kV long­ distance line connecting the hydro-electric stations of the Upper Rhine and Vorarlberg to the Ruhr industrial area via Herbertingen, Hoheneck, Rheinau, Kelsterbach, Koblenz, and Brauweiler substations, a distance by this route of 360. miles. Three 110 kV lines connect to Albbruck-Dogern, and two connect possibly to Klingau, two to Häusern power station, and two possibly to Berau switching station.

It produced nitro-cellulose during the 1914-1918 war (at the rate of 369 tons monthly) and was allowed to continue the manufacture of explosives, concentrating on the production of smokeless powder. From 1938 onwards considerable extensions have been made to the plant and to the number of persons employed there. A variety of reliable reports puts the 1943 pay-roll at between 13,000 and 15,000. On the assumption that this is primarily a propellant- powder plant, a production of about 40,000 tons a year is indicated. The factory is situated at Bomlitz, 5 miles N.N.E. of Walsrode.

It is the Eastern terminus of the Ems-Jade Canal and thus has access to the Dortmund-Ems Canal system. Wilhelmshaven is one of Germany’s largest naval bases and is the headquarters-of the North Sea Western Group and North Sea Coastal Defence Commands, The naval shipbuilding yards of Wilhelmshaven (the Kriegsmarine Werft) have built many famous German warships, including the 35,000 ton battle-cruiser Tirpitz. In the past few years, however, the port has chiefly concentrated on the building of submarines, mainly of the 500-ton class. The yards at Wilhelmshaven also undertake the repair and maintenance of E-boats and other light craft of a similar type. There are a number of oil-storage depots without the port area, described below under Liquid Fuels, but apart from the one firm listed under Engineering and Armaments, Wilhelmshaven contains no other industries of importance;

Port Area Wilhelmshaven (2) Wilhelmshaven has an extensive system of docks which extend for 5 miles along the Northern shore of the Jade Busen, the large bay at the mouth of the river Jade. These docks are all enclosed and are entered through three lock gates at the Eastern end.
The dock system is in course of expansion to the Northwards.
The yards of the Kriegsmarine Werft are situated in the Bau-Hafen which lies to the East of the town. It is the innermost of the harbours and has access to the sea via the Ausrüstungshafen.
The Grosser-Hafen is the chief coaling and nnw>erni port and lies immediately South of the town. It includes extensive quay and loading facilities, oil-storage plants, and rail sidings. Immediately to the West is the Zwischen-Hafen which contains one large and two small floating docks. The main coal-loading quays are in the Zwischen-Hafen.
Further West is the West-Hafen which includes the yards of the Deutsche Werke A.G. On the long sea-wall which divides the main docks from the Jade Busen are a number of oil-storage installations and the seaplane base which is mentioned below under ? Air craft and Aero Engines’*.
The Ems-Jade Canal enters the port from the West, passes through the Kanal-Hafen ( a channel with loading facilities which extends along the landward side of the dock system), and terminates in the Grosser-Hafen.
In the last few years reclamation work has been in progress immediately to the North-east, of the main port area where the coastline curves round to the Nortnw»»a, and it is reported that a new dock, outer port, and uthor harbour installations are in process of construction.

Railway Workshops Witten (3) The railway-repair workshops are situated immediately North of Witten station. The workshops are of medium size and employed 970 workers before the war.
Public Utility Services Herdecke Hydro Scheme
The Herdecke hydro scheme is based upon the Hei^jsteysee, an artificial reservoir created by damming the river Ruhr below its confluence with the Lenne, and consists of 3 hydro-electric stations and an important substation. The scheme has an installed capacity of 146 MV. and is owned by the Rheinisch-7/estfalisches Elektrizitätswerk A.G-. (RWE.) Essen.
Her^stey I & II Power Stations. Hengsteysee (3) These two power stations are part of the Herdecke Hydro scheme.
Hei^stey I, a flow station of 3 MW. capacity, is on the weir at the end of the reservoir. Hengstey II, a si mil ar station also of 3 MW. capacity, is on the river Ruhr a mile below Hengstey I, from which it is controlled. Both stations are of local importance only.
Koepchenwerk Hengsteysee (1) Thi s is the third and by far the most important of the stations which comprise the Herdecke hydro scheme.
The Koepchenwerk is a punped-storage station of 12*J0 MW. capacity; it is situated on the North bank of the Hengsteysee, 6 miles E.S.E. of Witten. 540 feet above the station is the upper storage reservoir, a smell er reservoir which is filled with water from the lower reservoir by pumps situated in the generator hall below. Four large pipe lines arranged in pairs connect the upper reservoir with the station; these made a conspicuous landmark but since the war have been heavily camouflaged.
WITTEN (oontd)
In the power house are 4 turbines, 4 alternators, and. 4 pumps. During low-consumption periods on the R.W.E* grid, the punps, operated by the alternators, replenish the upper reservoir* The station is for peak load »nd emergency use; its great importance lies in that when the upper reservoir is full, it can produce up to 140 MW. almost instantaneously.
Substation (4) The substation is adjacent to the power station; it has been developed since the war into a key switching station for the Ruhr industrial area, seconi in importance only to Brauweiler* The station was designed for eight 220-kV lines and two1lO-kV lines« Single-circuit 220-kV lines go to Leithe via Hattingen, Gersteinwerk (Stodkm), Brauweiler, Kruckel; double-circuit lines to Letmathe and Kreuztal* No definite information is available about the 110«kV lines; connections possibly go to the Cunowerk and Hattingen stations.

WITTENBERG ( contd. ) Sprengstoff A. G< (contd. ) The present lay-out of the plant agrees reasonably well with its ground plan at the end of the last war, with the significant difference that the T.N.T. manufacturing unit has been removed.
The nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine plants do not appear to have been much altered, and there appears to be some capacity for the manufacture of finished propellant powders. In 1938 it was reported that the Reinsdorf factory produced 15,000 tons of nitro-cellulose per annum, which is a little below the estimate of capacity made by the Armistice Commission in 1919. Examination of air photographs taken in May, 1943, suggests that the nitrocellulose capacity might be- about 25,000 tons per annum at the present time. Nitroglycerine, or diglycoldinitrate, plant appears to be installed, and the capacity may be very roughly estimated at about 6,000 tons per annum.
