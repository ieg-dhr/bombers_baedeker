It is highly industrialised,particularly in textiles and. engineering. Prior to the war thefamous Leipzig Trade Fair draw a large conmercial public from allparts of the world. Leipzig s main railway station is the largestin Europe. The Supreme Courts of Law of the Reich are established inthe city and Leipzig is also the centre of the German publishingindustry. Railway lines radiate from the city in all directions, andthere are extensive marshalling yards which form an inportant base forthe traffic to the Eastern Front. Leipzig's industries have been devel-oped chiefly on the outskirts of the town ani can be divided into twomain groups. The first extends from the main station to the North Eastand South of the city. This area contains several importantengineering plants, spinning and weaving mills, and the Northern powerstation. The second industrial group is on the Western outskirts.This district includes some of the largest wool and cotton spinningmills in Europe and a number of big engineering works.

Railway Repair Shops Delitzsch (3) At Delitzsch, 10 miles North of Leipzig, there are railway workshops formerly employing scan© 1,200 workers and undertaking chiefly the repair of goods wagons. Power Station Böhlen (1) This very large thermal power station is owned by the A.G. Sächsische Werke (aSW) and has an installed capacity of 393 MW. It is situated on the brown-coal deposits at Böhlen, 11 miles S. of Leipzig, and is part of a large industrial complex which includes, besides the power station, a synthetic-oil plant (described below under Liquid Fuels), a low temperature carbonisation plant, (described below under S. F.), and a gas-works (described below). The station is operated on base load and supplies current to the grid system and the city of Leipzig and is also the source of power to the synthetic-oil plant, whose estimated maximum demand is 75 MW with an annual consumption of over 500 million kWh. Five long-distance double-circuit 110 kV lines run to Chemnitz, Gossnitz, Zeitz, Lausen, and Leipzig respectively and another probably connects with the neighbouring double station of E: penhain- Molbis. Local 30 kV supplies connect to Leipzig by underground cables and at lower voltages to neighbouring industrial works. Gasworks Bohlen (3) The gas works is part of the ASW complex at BShlen and was erected in 1939 by the Company for the supply of domestic gas to Leipzig and the surrounding district. It operates the Luigi complete-gasification process, using brown coal.

It is a double station with duplicate generating plants 250'yards apart arranged opposite and parallel to each other. There is one switching and transformer station common to both sections, and it is assumed that a large part of the electrical output is supplied to the nearby industrial plant, to which steamis also supplied. The station was under construction at the beginning of the war and details are therefore incomplete. There are at least 4 long-distance overhead transmission lines, 2 running South-east (possibly one to Dresden and one to Chemnitz), one North-east (possibly to Leipzig), and one West (possibly to Böhlen).

It is not known whether the station is connected to the grid. </Public_Utility_Services><Chemicals_and_Explosives> I.G.Falbenindustrie A.G. Leverkusen (1+) The Leverkusen Works of the I.G. concern ^ere formerly known as Friedrich Bayer and Co. and are still frequently referred . to as the Bayer Works. The plant, which is responsible for a high proportion of the total German production of a number of important chemical products, is of very considerable importance in the German chemical industry. <pb n="440" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454599"/> One of its main activities is connected with the tableting and ampouling of pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations, serums and associated products. It is by far the largest tableting and ampouling works in Europe, and, apart from finishing medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations manufactured at the Leverkusen works, also undertakes the tableting and ampouling of practically the entire output of these products manufactured at Elberfeld, the largest German pharmaceutical plant, and Höchst. The heavy-chemical plant at Leverkusen consists primarily of the sulphuric-acid unit, which is estimated to have a capacity of tons per year or roughly 11$ of the total German capacity. It is the largest German sulphuric-acid unit. The plant is also an important producer of electrolytic caustic soda and chlorine' Leverkusen is also one of the largest German factories making dyes and associated products. Anong other preparations made here on a large scale are film base, films, photographic paper, filters and photographic chemicals. The works includes a synthetic- rubber plant producing ”Perdurine” rubber, estimated to have a capacity of 4,000 tons per annum. Several, apparently reliable, reports indicate that toxic acids and smoke- producing compounds are prepared at Lever- kusen. It is probable that the filling process would be carried out in one of the several filling stations Situated within the Cologne area. Situated within the works is the plant of the Titanium G.m.b.H., one of the leading German producers of titanium pignents. It is believed that the Leverkusen works employs more than 20,000 people. The works, which extend for over one mile along the river front,occupies the whole area between the river and the North-to-South railway along the right bank of the Rhine, which here runs parallel with, and approximately 1,100 yards from, the river. The works has extensive rail sidings, rail storage depots, and large harbour facilities. <pb n="441" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454600"/> Dynamit A.G. Schlebusch (2) This factoiy was of considerable importance in the last war. In 1918 it was one of the most important T. N. T. factories in Germany and produced more than 1,000 tons per month. It was one of the few factories permitted to continue the manufacture of T. N. T. under the Versailles Treaty and was produc- ing 294 tons monthly in 1923. Both ground reports and air photographs suggest that the factoiy has returned at least to its full former level of activity, and certain extensions appear to have been made. The factory has not only its own nitric-acid plant (as is common practice in large explosives factories), but also its own sulphuric-acid plant using the contact process, which is unusual. It is apparent that T. N. T. is still the chi© product of the plant, capacity being probably about 15,000 tons per annum. It is clear that other explosives are also made at Schlebusch but it is not certain what these are. It almost certainly has plant for the manufacture of nitroglycerine, which may now be used for the production of diglycoldinitrate. In the last war the factoiy produced a small quantity of hexanitrodiphenyl-sulphide, and although this explosive does not now appear to be used by the German forces the plant would be suit- able for the manufacture of hexanitrodiphenylamine.</Chemicals_and_Explosives></city><city name="LIEGNITZ"><state>Silesia</state><coordinates>51.15,16.10</coordinates><distance> 700 miles</distance><population> 78.000</population><Description> Liegnitz is in Lower Silesia, 40 miles West of Breslauon the main line from Berlin.

The nature of this new explosive is uncertain, but it may be hexanitrodipheuylamine (which is commonly used in German torpedoes and mines), or it may be hexogen. It is significant that the site of manufacture of hexogen in Germany has not been positively identified, although this explosive is now used by the German forces. The factory is reported to be opened by Dynamit A. G , but its ownership has not been confirmed. It lies 4 kms. from Luniw on the west bank of the river Oder.

Its position on the River Elbe and on one of the main Northto South trade routes of Europe has given it from the earliest timesa commercial and industrial importance which it has maintained up tothe present day. It is one of the principal traffic centres of CentralGermany, and has a railway junction which is second only to Berlinitself with lines radiating N. to Hamburg and Rostock, E. to Berlinand the Baltic ports, S.E. to Leipzig and Czechoslovakia, S. toHalle, Nürnberg and Munich, and W. to Hanover and the Ruhr. Thecentral German Leipzig-Magdeburg lines have been electrified. Themain part of the town is on the left bank of the Elbe, and is aclosely built-up area. Industries and groups of industries aresituated round most of the town's perimeter. One important groupis at Neustadt and Rothensee, on the northern outskirts, but theGrusonwerk of Krupps, which occupies the first place in Magdeburg'sindustries, is in Buckau, the southern portion of the town. There are large marshalling and goods yards both in Rothensee andin Buckau. The Western quarter of the town, which is known as theWilhelmstadt, and the Eastern suburb of Friedrichstadt, which is onthe right bank of the Elbe, contain groups of industries. The Elbedivides into two channels, forming an island which lies betweenMagdeburg and Friedrichstadt. This island is itself intersected bya third .narrow river channel (the Zoll Elbe)and contains an inlandharbour, with warehouses and storage depots. The Mittelland Canal follows an E. -W. course 6 miles N. of thetown, but this important waterways route is broken where it shouldbe carried over the Elbe, due to the failure to complete theaqueduct, and also by the double ship lift at Hohenwarthe mile tothe east of the aqueduct. Barges therefore have to negotiate the40-60 ft. change in level to the river by the Rothensee shiplift,pass down the N. -S, branch canal into the Elbe, and rejoin theIhle section of the canal by the locks at Niegripp, a distance ofsome 8 miles by water from the Rothensee shiplift. The town of Schönebeck, 9 miles to the South of Magdeburg,where there are aircraft, ammunition, and chemical factories, isdealt with separately. </Description><Transportation>Inland Harbour Magdeburg (2) Magdeburg has extensive inland harbour facilities for the Elbe traffic. The Handelshafen and the Industriehafen, the two largest docks, are at the Northern end of the town close to the industrial areas of Neustadt and Rothensee. There are several smaller docks and loading basins further downstream at Rothensee and connected with the Weser-Elbe Canal by the N. -S. branch canal and the Rothensee shiplift. This is part of the Mittelland Kanal system, which is continued Eastward from the Elbe to link up with the Oder. There is a further large dock known as the Zollhafen on the island formed by the two arms of the Elbe between Magdeburg and the suburb of Friedrichstadt. Magdeburg hamiles up to 2 million tons of waterborne goods per annum, including grain, sugar beet, vegetables, coal and timber. <pb n="454" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454613"/> The shiplift is situated at the top of the N. -S. branch canal dose to its junction with the Mittolland canal; it can lift or lower barges up to 1,000 tons to the maximum of 60 ft. required by the level of the Elbe. Railway Junction Magdeburg (3) The main line from Hamburg to Halle and Saxony passes through Magdeburg from North to South. One of the principal routes from Berlin to the Lower Rhineland crosses the Elbe at Rothensee and continues westwards from Magdeburg to Brunswick. Five other important branch lines radiate from Magdeburg. The railway junctions are in the Rothensee area and to the South of the main railway station. Marshalling Yard and Repair shops Buckau (2) The Buckau marshalling yard is the most important in Magdeburg, and has capacity for handling 3,800 wagons per 24 hours.

Construction of a synthetic rubber plant was announced early in 1937 and completed in 1940. Unlike the plant at Schkopau, Hdls was designed to make its acetylene from hydrocarbon gases by the electric arc process; otherwise the same four-stage process is used, It is believed that when production first started gas was used from the existing coke oven plant, but at a later date a pipe line from the Gelsenkirchen oil plant was completed and presumably the waste hydrocarbon gases from this plant are now used, either alone or in conjunction with the coke oven gas. It is believed that the styrene and aciylic nitrile also required for Buna production are made within the works. Power comes principally from a plant within the works of about 150 mW. capacity which is owned by Steinkohlen Kiekt ria it Äts A.G. Essen, (Steag), a subsidiary of the R.W.E. This plant has been leased to Chemische Werke Httls for fifteen years.

Prior to 1933 it was the seat of the Bavarian Government. Munich is the birthplace of the Nazi Movement and has become the headquarters of the Nazi Party. The city is in the Bavarian highlands, and is 1,700 feet above sea level. It lies to the North of the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, and is on the River Isar. Munich is the centre of an important network of railways and has direct connection with France (through Strassburg), with Austria (through Rosenheim), and with Italy (through Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass). Munich was the residence of the Kings of Bavaria. It is a university town, and a cultural centre of European importance. Traditionally the city has long been celebrated for artistic handi- crafts, including bronze founding, glass staining, silversmith's work, and wood carving, in addition to the manufacture of astron- omical and mathematical in st imments. During the present century a big development of Munich³s engineering industry has taken place, and there are now several large works, which are of the highest value to Germany's war production, making railway locomotives, aircraft and other engines, chemicals, and rubber tyres. The larger of these firms are mentioned below, including the E: M.W. aero-engine works and the four plants now established in Munich by the Dornier concern. In addition to these, there are reports of further new aircraft and aero-engine factories having been opened in the Munich area by Messerschmitt and Daimler-Benz, Also included in the Munich area are the Oberwiesenfeld air- field district North-west of Munich (where the B.M.W. and other works are situated), the suburbs of Moosach to the North East, Pasing to the West and Höllriegelskreuth which lies about 5 miles South of Munich.

Two diversionary canals are used. Seven miles North-east of Munich the Isar is diverted into a large reservoir fron which a aanal has been cut to rejoin the river 18 miles to the North near Moosburg. The four power stations of this (the Middle Isar) group are at Finsing where the canal leaves the reservoir at Aufkirchen, at Eitting, and at Pfrombach. The capacities of these stations are 11, J6, 32, and 28 MW. respectively. Between Munich and Moosburg the Isar has a course of 32 miles and gives a 290 head to this group of stations. The annual electrical output of the Middle Isar group is nearly 500 million kWh and is supplied in approximately equal parts to the State Railways and the city of Munich. From Moosburg to Landshut the canal is continued close to the right bank along a 15-mile stretch of the river, giving a head of 60.

G. Farben concern. The Piesteritz works are important producers of nitrogenous fertilisers, notably nitro-phoska and calcium cyanamide. Nitro-phoska is a combined nitrogen-phosphorus-potash fertiliser. The production of calcium cyanamide for the two plants, Piesteritz and Trostberg in Bavaria, is believed to be 125,000 tons per annum. There is also a plant at Piesteritz for the manufacture of concentrated nitric acid, of which the production is 60 tons daily. These works are also reported to be the largest producers of phosphorus in Europe. In 1932 it was reported that the annual production was approximately 30,000 tons. There are three 3~phase furnaces, each consuming 12,000 kW. In normal times a large part of this phosphorus was sent to Wolfen for the manufacture of phosphoric acid, itself used for makingsnitro-phoska. Phosphorus is used for the manufacture of incendiary bombs, tracer/incendiary Si A.A., . simple tracer S.A.A., and larger-calibre tracer shells made with pyrotechnic compositions. Fire-raising ansnunition is almost entirely dependent on phosphorus. It is also used in smoke-producing shells for ranging purposes.

This port is now of part inula rvalue in view of the large amount of Roumanian oil which is shipped toit up the Danube. The pre-war industries of Regensburg also included shipbuilding,the manufacture of tiles, drainage pipes and stoneware, and severalsmall engineering works. There are a number of saw-mills, and theinland port handled a large amount of timber. The Regensburg worksof the Messerschmitt A.G., have been greatly developed during the war.

Production began in 1938 and the plant has concentrated ever since on successive models of the Me. 109 single-engined fighter. With the expansion programme instituted in the German aircraft industry in 1942-43 output increased considerably until the effective daylight air attack of August 1943. A second Messerschmitt plant has been established by the conversion and extension of a former G.A.F. station at Obertraubling, 4 miles to the South-east of Regensburg. This works was engaged on the assembly of the large Messerschmitt transport glider, (the Me.321) and of the powered version of the same aircraft (the 6-engined Me.323). The August attack on Prüfening was so effective that Me. 109 assembly was for the most paid; transferred to Obertraubling, while Me. 321 and 323 assembly began at Leipheim where assembly space had been acquired. Reconstruction of the Prüfening works was vigorously undertaken and production resumed. A series of raids in February 1944 inflicted such severe damage that the plant is thought likely to be abandoned. Obertraubling was bombed in the same February raids with equal effective- ness and no attempts at assembly repair work had been <pb n="568" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454727"/> macle by early April.

Marienehe was the research and development centre and has been responsible for the design of a long series of Heinkel types (bombers, seaplanes, transport types, etc.). The main type produced is the He.Ill twin-engined bomber which has been in production in successive versions since 1935' The He. 177 heavy bomber has been built in small numbers since 1941 but large-scale assembly has been transferred elsewhere (Oranienburg and Arado, Brandenburg). Marienehe still produces the twin - He.Ill five - engined glider-towing aircraft. The works are on a large scale with five assembly halls and over 20 separate machine shops. They have been continually expanded during the past few years. Large-scale production of Heinkel types was also from 1937 under- taken at the Oranienburg subsidiary (He.Ill's) near Berlin and in 1942-43 at the Schwechat plant near Vienna (He.219 twin-engined dive-bomber and recently He.280 Jet-propelled fighter).

The industrial targets in the area are concentrated in a narrowstrip of territory which extends East from the river Rhine and is about30 miles long and 10 miles wide; and which lies approximately betweenthe river Ruhr and the Rhe in-Herne canal. The Ruhr and the adjacentareas in Rhineland and Westphalia contain a concentration of industrywhich is without parallel in Europe. An almost unbroken chain of greatindustrial cities runs from Duisburg in the West through Oberhausen,Mülheim, Essen, Giesenkirchen, and Bochum to Dortmund in the East. Notwithstanding the policy of industrial dispersal and the heavyair attacks, there has been no appreciable movement of heavy industryaway from the Ruhr to safer areas and, although strenuous efforts havebeen made to develop new heavy industrial plants elsewhere, the Ruhrarea retains nearly all of its pre-war importance as the principalcentre of heavy industry in Germany.Division into districts For trie purpose of this report the Ruhr has been divided into 14districts, under which headings they should be sought in the text.These conform roughly with the district boundaries as marked on theG.S.andS.

The heavy press capacity at Rüsselsheim is partly devoted to the fabrication of Ju.88 bomber components for supply to the assembly plants at Bernburg and elsewhere. These components incl trie the frameworks for cockpit covers, for transparent nose units and for gun turret covers. In addition aero-engine bearers, cowlings and nacelles are made, together with undercarriages and tail wheels, all for the same type of aircraft. <pb n="590" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454749"/> In a special department airscrew reduction gears for fitting to Daimler-Benz aero-engines are made and supplied to the DE: aero-engine factories.

Rüsselsheim (1) These works, occupying a larga site West and South West of Rüsselsheim, with a quay frontage on the South bank of the Main, at one time produced the Opel range of cars and lorries. They were owned by General Motors. Their pre-war output was up to 120,000 units annually, the works having a productive capacity at,the rate of 200,000 units per annum. In 1935, lorry production was transferred to a new plant at Brandenburg, many of the components continuing to be made at Rüsselsheim, however. At the outbreak of war car production was stopped and a portion of the plant was converted to the manufacture of air-frame components for Junkers 88 aircraft. Aircraft propellor reduction gearing for Daimler-Benz aircraft engines was also manufactured. In addition, large quantities of vehicle spare parts continued to be made, Rüsselsheim being responsible for maintaining the Opel service and repairs organisation, whilst parts were sent to the loriy producing plant at Brandenburg. It was reported early in 1943 that Rüsselsheim was to concentrate upon lorry production, and several reports concerning the manufacture of lorries at this plant have been received. On the other hand, several references to the manufacture of aircraft engines have been received in 1943 In addition, reference has been made to the manufacture of armoured cars, tracked motor cycles, and amphitfous vehicles. The number of workers has been variously reported and the whole Rüsselsheim complex would appear to employ 20,000 to 25,⁰⁰⁰ workers including a large number of foreigners. <pb n="591" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454750"/> </Engineering_and_Armaments></city><city name="SAALFELD"><state>Thuringia</state><coordinates>50.40,11.20</coordinates><distance> 500 miles</distance><population> 20.000</population><Description> Saalfeld is on the left bank of the River Saale and on one ofthe min North to South railway routes through the Thuringian hills.A paper mill and a number of small iron foundries and engineeringworks constitute the main industries of Saalfeld itself.

These dams and their reservoirs, which impound a water volume almost equal to the annual flow of the Saale, are among the largest in Germany. The water power thus created is used to serve an important hydro scheme. The four generating stations described below are now fully developed, and it is probable that plans exist for further constructions which will greatly increase the output. -N.ar Saalburg, 20 miles South-east of Saalfeld, is the Bleilooh dam and reservoir and its adjacent Burgkhanrner compensating reservoir. The generating stations of these two have capacities of 40 UW and 5 respectively. A pump- storage station operates between the two reservoirs. Pour miles South-east of Saalfeld, near the village of Kaulsdorf, is the Hohenwarte dam and reservoir and its adjacent Eichicht compensating reservoir.

Saarbrücken is a railway Junction for several branch lines serving the industrial regions of the Saar and of Lorraine. The coalfields of the Saar Basin, which extend mainly to the North of the town, are among the largest in Europe and, together with the rich iron-ore deposits of Lorraine, they yield raw material for the highly-developed iron and steel industry in these regions. Several iron and steel works are established in Saarbrücken itself. The industries include a number of engineering works which, though individually on a small scale, constitute in the aggregate a valuable factor in the German war production. The industrial area extends along the valley of the River Saar from the outskirts of V611 ingen (5 miles to the West) to Brebach and Neusohtfidt, 3 miles to the East of Saarbrücken The river Saar is navigable and is an important means of transport for the products of this region. </Description><Transportation> Inland Harbour Saarbrücken (3) This small inland harbour is in the centre of the town and consists of one large ere scent-shaped dock on the right bank of the river Saar.

According to a report published in 1934 by the PrussianGeological Institute (Die Eisenerzvorrate des Deutschen Reiches)thesize of the deposits of ore that could be worked as an economicproposition was 35 million tons while there was a further 65 milliontons of ore that would require more favourable business conditions suchas cheap fireight and higher steel prices before it could be considered. These two categories of ore were at a depth of a few feet to nearly1,000 feet below the surface, but going to a depth of 3,300 feet atleast MX)million tons of ore were available. It has since been statedthat the estimate of volume of ore was much too low. Features commonto all the Salzgitter ores are their high phosphorus content, whichmakes them suitable for the basic Bessemer process, and their high silicacontent, which,, until the discovery by Brassert of .the means of usingacid burdens in blast furnaces, rendered them unsuitable for smeltingwithout the mixture of other ores. The greater part of the Salzgitterores have an extremely low iron content but among the best grades aresome with an iron content of about 40 per cent. Before the introductionof the Brassert process and the erection of the Reichswerke HermannGering, the best Salzgitter ores were mined to the extent of ä fewhundred thousand tons per annum by the nearby Ilseder Hütte of Peine,which mixed them with the limey Peine ores, and by certain Ruhr workswhich mixed them with imported ores. Following the successful introduction in the mid-thirties of acidburdening at Corby in Northamptonshire where the ores are also sicilious,the large scale working of Salzgitter ores became a practical propositionprovided a works was erected on the spot. In pursuance of its policyof aiming at raw material self-sufficiency the Nazi Governmenttherefore decided to build such a plant and to link it by a specialcanal with the Mittelland Canal so as to provide cheap transport to andfrom the Ruhr. In the barges bringing the necessary coking coal forthe works' own coke ovens it was planned to send back Salzgitter oreto the Ruhr works. Thus, as a result of Government action, conditionswere created for the use of Salzgitter ores to an extent far exceedinganything conceived by the Prussian Geological substitute.

Ground reports have suggested that the output of T. N. T. at this plant is very large indeed. Some reports put it as high as 60,000 tons per annum. Examination of photographic cover prior to the attack on the plant early in 1944 suggests that on the basis of the size of buildings, etc., the T. N. T. capacity may be of the order of 40,000 tons per annum. There are two large T. N. T. manufacturing units which appear to be identical, and one smaller unit of somewhat different layout. Some new <pb n="606" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454765"/> construction was then in hand, but it is not yet clear whether this was intended for high- explosives manufacture or not. The photographs suggest that, in addition to T. N. T. amatol is also prepared in this plant by mixing some part of the T. N. T. production with ammonium nitrate. This may be the explanation of the very high figures for T. N. T. output which have been given from some sources. Ground sources have suggested that there are two factories making explosives at Schbnebeck. This is not confirmed by air photographs, and it is suggested that the second explosives factory reported is in fact the Patronen Zündhütchen und Metallwarenfabrik, which is a fuse-making establishment in the neigh- bourhood., and which has mounded buildings for the storage of explosives and detonators. The high-explosives factory lies in open country on rising ground on the south bank of the river Elbe, about 2 km. due west of Schbnebeck railway station, and 1J km. south- west from the river bank. Ground reports have stated that shells are also filled in this factory, but air photographs do not confirm this, and it would be very unusual practice to use an explosives factory for filling weapons. It is probable, however, that there is a filling factory in the immediate neighbourhood. The factory was almost completely destroyed only in 1944, probably as a by-product of the raid of January 21/22, 1944 on Magdeburg.Chemische Werke Schönebeck (-) The Chemische Werke Schbnebeck A.G. are makers of heavy chemicals, including hydro- chloric acid, sodium sulphate and finished materials for the ceramic industry.

As with many similar remote towns in the Black Forest,watch and clock making is the traditional industry. In the case ofSchramberg, however, the development of the firm of Junghans has giventhe town outstanding importance in this branch. Apart from a few minorwatch makers, the activities of Schramberg are entirely concerned withthe Junghans works. </Description><Engineering_and_Armaments> Junghans Schramberg (1) The Gebr. Junghans A.G. Uhrenfabriken are the largest individual firm of watch and clock makers in the Blade Forest area. In peacetime they employed some 5,000 workers and were capable of producing watches and clocks at the rate of 27,000 daily. The parent works of the concern are in Schramberg and include, in addition to the large watch- making factory, a section devoted to the manufacture of the precision tools required in this industry. a separate saw mill and woodworking factory, also in Schramberg, prepares the wooden casings for the clocks. . The works has its own hydro-electric power plant. A branch factory in Lehengericht, 5 miles North of Schramberg, makes watch springs. There is a second smaller watch factory in Schwenningen 15 miles to the South East of Schramberg, and a components factory in Rotteriburg 30 miles to the North- east of Schramberg. The factories in Schramberg, which are now said to number three separate plantF, are believed to employ some 1J,000 workers and^ in addition to a fairly wide range of precision instruments, are now largely turned over to the manufacture of fuzes. <pb n="608" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454767"/> Together with the firm Gebr. Thiel df Ruhla in Thuringia, this production of fuzes is reported to amount to 100,000 daily. There is an apprentices' school in Schramberg where up to 200 mechanics and watch makers are under training. During the latter half of 1943 the number of foreign workers, which had hitherto been small, was increasing continually, mostly Frenchmen and Ukrainians of both sexes being engaged. Although the firm's payroll has increased from 5,000 to 13,000 in the course of the war it is unlikely that the number of workers actually employed in the Junghans factories has increased to any major extent because they were already working to capacity before the war. It is assumed that seme 7,000 to 8,000 workers are employed by sub-contractors or are "home workers'. <pb n="609" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454768"/> </Engineering_and_Armaments></city><city name="SCHWABACH"><state>Bavaria</state><coordinates>49.20,11.</coordinates><distance> 515 miles</distance><population>   15.000</population><Description> Schwabach is 7 miles South of Nürnberg on the main railway lineto Munich.

It is on therailway route from Northern Germany to Stuttgart and on the East toWest line from Bamberg to Mainz and the Rhine valley. The Main is already navigable for heavy barges as far asAschaffenburg, but it is possible that the project to connect the Mainwith the Danube has already progressed upstream beyond Schweinfurt,in which case the hitherto small inland harbour will have increased inimportance. Schweinfurt is the largest centre of the German ball bearingindustry and normally produces well over half the total requirements.This manufacture is carried on mainly in four large factories whichare grouped round the main railway station on the South-westernoutskirts of the town. The technical equipment and individual skillrequired in this industry, on which many e. and a.branches depend have been developed over a long period and have madeSchweinfurt a highly specialised industrial community which it isdifficult to transplant or replace. As a result of several bombing attacks very severe damage hasbeen done to the four principal factories. </Description><Transportation> Inland Harbour Schweinfurt (3) There is a small harbour on the North bank of the River Main in the industrial district of Schweinfurt to the West of the town centre. This harbour, which is served by railway sidings, is close to the V.K.F. plant.

(-) When in full production the group of Schweinfurt factories belonging to this concern formed by far the most important unit in the German ball-bearing industry. The V.K.F. group employed at least 10,000 workers. The chief plants are described below. This concern extended its range of production during the war to include tape n-ro Iler, barrel-roller and the heaviest types of bearings, V .K.F. Werk I (Schweinfurter Präzisions- Kugellagerwerke Fichte1 and Sachs, Wandlzlager Abteilung) Schweinfurt (1) This factory was purchased from the Schweinfurt firm of Fichtel and Sachs in 1929. In 1938, 3,000 to 3500 workers were employed. It produced all types of bearing, including the majority of the German output of precision bearings, and concentrated particularly on the finishing and assembling processes, receiving part of its requirements of semi- products from V.K.F. Werk XI and other sources. V .K.F. Werk II (Deutsche Gusstahlkugel and Maschinenfabrik A.G. vorm. Fries and Hbpf linger) Schweinfurt (1) This factory was also acquired in 1929. It produced all types of bearings, and was also engaged in the production of balls and the machining of races for Werk I, where the finishing and final assembly was carried out. 4500 to 5000 workers were employed in 1938, It is believed that the plant has been extended since । the war by taking over neighbouring premises. In addition to standard varieties of bearing, these two works have also, in recent years, taken up the manufacture of the heaviest types of bearings, as well as taper-roller and barrel-roller bearings. These had formerly been imported from Sweden. Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.nub.H. Schweinfurt (2) The section of the V.K.F. concern known as the Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.m.b.H, was before the war engaged exclusively on the production of ball-bearing cages. They supplied these to the other ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt and to the open market. Approximately 1,000 workers ware employed. The priority ratings are based op the pre- raid value of these objectives. <pb n="615" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454774"/> Kugelfischer (Erste Automatische Gusstahlfabrik vormals F. Fischer) Schweinfurt (1+) The Schweinfurt plant of the Kugelfischer Schoefer A.G. combine is immediately North of the railway line and main station. It is the largest single factory in the German ball bearing industry and produced all types of ball and roller bearings, with the exception of the heaviest industrial bearings, before the war. 5,000 to 6,000 hands were employed in 1938, but figure had risen to 7,000 by 1939 ^he size of the works has been much increased since the outbreak of war. It is, therefore, the largest individual factory in the German ball bearing industry, and reports received prior to the air attacks suggested that as many as 12,000 workers were employed.Fichtel and Sachs Ernst Sachs Str. (1) The ball bearing factory belonging to this firm was taken over by the V.K.F. and is now Werk I of that concern as mentioned above The firm of Fichtel and Sachs, .though possibly now affiliated with the V.K.F. concern, still retains its identity and continues to operate under its own name. The works make light weight motorcycles, motor boat engines, cycle hubs and other motor vehicle components, including the F and S patent clutch which is widely used in the German motor industry. A limited range of small ball-bearings for use in their own products is produced in the section of the plant retained by Fichtel and Sachs. The works has been enlarged since 1939 and reports suggest that the new workshops are mainly engaged on the manufacture of motor vehicle components for the open market and small arms components and ammunition. </Engineering_and_Armaments><Chemicals_and_Explosives> Deutsche Gelatine Schweinfurt (3) The Deutsche Gelatine Fabriken, whose works are North East of the main railway station, manufacture gelatine in powder and in sheet form for food and technical purposes. The products include photographic gelatine for film and paper emulsions, and a special gelatine for use as a protecting separative for photographic films. This firmis the best known producer of photographic gelatine in Germany. Some 800 workers are employed. The priority ratings are based on the pre- raid value of these objectives.SCHELM (Westphalia) See under Hagen <pb n="616" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454775"/> </Chemicals_and_Explosives></city><city name="SCHWENNINGEN"><state>Württemberg</state><coordinates>48.5,8.30</coordinates><distance> 455 miles</distance><population>   22.000</population><Description> Schwenningen is in the South-western area of Württemberg on theEastern side of the Black Forest.

Not only is nitro-cellulose made in large quantities for the production of celluloid-type plastics, but a variety of other plastic materials, <pb n="623" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454782"/> among which laminated articles made fron bakelite are perhaps the most important, are also made here. It is quite likely, that some explosive nitrocellulose is still manufactured here, and indeed this view is supported by the examination of air photographs. It is difficult to estimate what part of the nitrocellulose capacity is available for explosives manufacture. The total installed capacity represents about 12,000 tons per annum, but the majority of this will certainly be used for plastics manufacture. The factory is important as being one of the largest producers of detonators in Germany. It introduced the manufacture of lead azide detonators in aluminium caps. Even before the war the production of these detonators was running at the rate of about 120 million per annum, and there is little doubt that it has been increased since. The factory prepares its own raw materials for detonators, having a sodium azide plant with an output in excess of 160 tons per annum.

It is the nearest port to Berlin, which lies84 miles to the South-west. It has direct rail communications withBerlin, Frankfurt (Oder), and Danzig, and through the River Oder isjoined up to the main North German inland-waterway system. It playsan important part in the seaborne supply arrangements for the EasternFront. The central area of Stettin is a compact mass composed mainlyof dwelling houses and offices. The industrial area extends alongthe river from the dock area in the south-eastern quarter of thecity northwards along the left bank to Gutzlow. Kost of theimportant industrial plants are in this area. The main industry of Stettin is connected with its shipyards.No large vessels are built here, but there is considerable activityin the building and fitting-out of submarines, mine sweepers, navalescort vessels, and tank landing craft. The shipyard area is inthe neighbourhood of Grabow, which is on the left bank of the riverone mile to the North of the main railway bridge. The Vulkanshipyards have been considerably extended during the war. Oppositethe shipbuilding yards is the Bredow Werder, a large island in thechannel of the Oder, which is in process of being converted intoan industrial area and naval base. At the South end of this islanda large dock basin has been excavated. The port or dock area is onthe right bank of the Oder immediately North of the marshalling yards,and in the neighbourhood of the docks is a large concentration ofwarehouses, timber yards, oil depots, and small factories. <pb n="646" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454806"/> In Pommerensdorf, a southern suburb of Stettin, there arechemical works and a large electric power station, which aredescribed below.An important factory lying outside the general industrial areais the Stoewer Werke A.G-., which is situated to the West of the townin the suburb of Westend. The outlying district of Pölitz, 8 miles to the North of Stettin,contains an important synthetic-oil plant and an electricgenerating station. These are included with Stettin in the listbelow. The town of Altdamm, which lies to the South-east of Stettin,is dealt with separately. </Description><Transportation> Port Area Stettin (2) The port and dock area are opposite the centre of the town on the right bank of the Oder. There are two harbours with rail sidings which lead from the marshalling yards immediately to the South East. The Freihafen, one of the docks immediately opposite to the city centre, has some of the largest dock warehouses in Europe, including a large grain elevator. The whole dock area, including the island known as the Silber-Wiese, at the point where the main railway crosses the Oder, is closely built with warehouses, timber yards, saw mills, oil storage depots, and small factories. Stettin is an important transhipment centre for the Upper Silesian coal which is conveyed in barges down the Oder direct from the coalfields. Railway Centre Stettin (2) The main line from Berlin, which continues beyond Stettin north-eastwards parallel with the Baltic coast, forms a direct route from Berlin to Danzig. Other lines radiate from Stettin north-westwards to Stralsund, south- wards to Küstrin, and northwards via Gollnow round the Eastern side of the Stettiner Haff to Swinemfinde. Three other minor branch lines serve the agricultural districts to the West and South-west of the town.

It lies in a valleysurrounded by wooded hills which open out in the East into thevalley of the river Neckar, The town has grown in size consider-ably since the end of the last century, the development being' due mainly to the engineering industry consisting principally oflight and electrical engineering. Together with the adjoiningsuburb of Zuffenhausen, Feuerbach forms one of the chief industria-lised quarters of the Stuttgart district. The second industrialarea is in Cannstatt and Affinster, which are to the North of thecity centre and on the left bank of the river Neckar, This areaincludes an important ball-bearing works, the town's electricpower station, and several precision-engineering works. A thirdindustrial district is East of the city centre and on the rightbank of the river, extending Southeastward from UntertÖrkheimup the river valley to Esslingen. The highly important main plantof the Daimler-Benz concern is in Untertürkheim, which alsocontains large marshalling yards and railway-repair shops. Halfwaybetween Untertürkheim and Esslingen are the "Index” works ofHahn A Tessky, one of Germany's leading makers of machine tools.The manufacture of machine tools and measuring instruments is ahighly-developed industry in Stuttgart and also in the neighbouringsettlements of Esslingen, 4 miles to the South-east, It ischaracteristic of Stuttgart, as indeed of the whole of Württemberg,that in normal times industry tends to remain in the hands of alarge number of medium-sized or small firms. This is particularlythe case with machine tools, and it is, therefore, not possibleto include all the numerous firms which in the aggregate makeStuttgart a vital factor in the German engineering industry,Stuttgart is an important railway centre and is on the mainroutes from the North to Zurich and from Munich to Karlsruheand France. </Description><Transportation> Railway Centre Stuttgart (2) The main railway station is situated in the centre of the town and is one of the largest terminal railway stations in Germaiy. Stuttgart lies on two important trunk routes, from North Germany to Zurich, and from Munich to Karlsruhe and France, Two branch lines lead East and West to SchwÄbisch-Gmünd and Bandblingen respectively, and several minor branches serve the neighbouring industrial settlements, including Sindelfingen, Kornwestheim and Ludwigsburg. Marshalling Yards Untertörkhei (3) These marshalling yards are capable of handling up to 2,200 wagons per 24 hours. Goods Yards Stuttgart (3) The principal goods yards occupy a area to the North-east of the main station and have extensive storage facilities. <pb n="658" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454818"/> Goods Yards Bad Canstatt (3) Extensive goods yards lie on the Western side of the large railway-repair shops South of the suburban station of Bad Cannstatt on the right bank of the Neckar. Railway Repair Shops Stuttgart (2) There are railway-repair shops at Bad Cannstatt and Stuttgart-Nord. At Bad Cannstatt the repair of all kinds of rolling stock, including passenger coaches, is undertaken, and at Stuttgart- Nord the repair of goods wagons. Some 2,000 workers are employed in Bad Caristatt and 500 in Stuttgart-Nord repair shops alone. In addition to the above there are also repair shops employing some 900 workers at Esslingen. </Transportation><Public_Utility_Services> Power Station Stuttgart (2) This thermal power station is situated in Münster, a northern suburb of Cannstatt. It is owned by the Stuttgart Corporation and has an installed capacity of 87 MW. In addition to the general town supply, power is delivered for railway traction. There are no important long-distance supplies' An adjacent 6/110 kV substation is owned by Elektrizitäts-Versorgung Württemberg A.G. and provides supplies for traction locally and via a 110-kV transmission line through Plochingen to Pasing to serve the electrified Stuttgart-Ulm-Augsburg-Munich railway line (single-phase circuit). A substation for 3/10 kV transmits supplies locally. Medium-voltage lines connect to Degerloch and Obertürkheim. Power Station Marbach (2) The Marbach plant consists- of a large thermal station, begun in 1938 and completed since the outbreak of war, and a small hydro station, and has an installed capacity of 108 MW. It is situated on the river Neckar about 10 miles North of Stuttgart and this relatively remote location was probably chosen mainly as an air-raid precaution. It is believed that practically the whole electrical output is supplied to the grid at the 220-kV Hoheneck substation and the 110-kV Obertürkheim sub- station from whence a part is transmitted to Stuttgart. The small hydro station has an installed capacity of 3 MW. An outdoor substation contains 4 double-circuit 110-kV lines, of which one, possibly two, connects to Obertüikheim and two to Hoheneck. <pb n="659" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454819"/> Substation Hoheneck (2) This important substation is situated 2 miles South-west of the Harbach generating station. It is being extended and identification is therefore uncertain. The station is on the 220-kV (planned 380—kV) long-distance line which links the water- power stations of the mountainous regions on the southern frontiers of Germany with the Ruhr industrial area. There are three adjoining sections for 220 kVF 110 kV and 60 kV respectively. Each section has duplicate busbars. Two 380/220-kV circuits connect to Rheinau and two to Herbertingen. One 220-kV circuit connects to Ellwangen. Two (possibly) 110-kV circuits connect to Pforzheim and two (possibly) to Heilbronn. Two double 110-kV circuits are under construction to Haibach station. Two 60-kV circuits go to Heilbronn, two to Pleideslheim, and one to Enzberg. It is believed that there are transformers for voltages lower than 60 kV.

The Hirth Motoren G.m.b.H. occupies the same site, and works.in close co-operation with the aoove firm. The ground reports suggest that since early 194J0 approximately 1,000 workers have been employed at the Zuffenhausen factory, and there are indications that, in addition to research and experimental work, a small range of aero-engine components manufactured here. Elektronmetall G.m.b.H' Bad Cannstatt (3) This firm specialises in the manufacture of pistons and piston rings, brakes, and shock absorbers for the aircraft industry. Other products include light-metal components for aircraft instruments, particularly radio equipment. Leichtmetallbau G.m.b.H. Bad Cannstatt (3) It is believed that this firm employs 3/400 workers on the manufacture of air- craft components, in particular shock absorbers and components for aircraft undercarriages, brakes, and other aircraft equipment. J.Eberspächer Esslingen (3) I This factory has been considerably enlarged since 1939, and has acquired at least one of the neighbouring factory sites, apait frcm erecting two new workshops adjacent to its old premises. It is believed to be engaged mainly on the manufacture of air- craft components and cylinder-baffling silencers, air filters, and other aero-engine components. Other products of the firm are components for flame throwers, and reports suggest that a number of other firms in Esslingen supply Eberspächer with major and minor components for flame throwers, indicating that assembly of flame throwers is likely to be undertaken by them. <pb n="661" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454821"/> Daimler-Benz A.G. UntertÜrkheim (1) The principal pre-war activity of this company was the manufacture of motor vehicles, and it is believed that the major part of the very extensive old Daimler-Benz works at Untertürkheimis still employed on work connected with the ijiotor-vehicle industry. This aspect of the Daimler-Benz production is dealt with below, under "Engineering and Armaments", and the following relates exclusively to those pai'ts of the works which are believed to be engaged on aero- engine work. For several years prior to the war the Daimler- Benz company undertook the development of aero-engines, and prototypes were built and tested at this works. It is thought that up to 1939 no large-scale production of aero- engines was undertaken, except at the branch factories at Genshagen and Marienfelde, near Berlin. Reports suggest that these two factories were supplied with components from Untertürkheim. It is not definitely known when the complete construction of aero- engines at UntertÜrkheim commenced, but it seems probable that it was during the early part of 1942. Up to the end of that year aero-engines erected at Untertürkheim were transported to Sindelfingen for testing, but since then the UntertÜrkheim works has been very greatly extended, and it is clear from reconnaissance photographs that most of the sections are connected with the production of aero-engines, which is now taking place at Stuttgart on a large scale. Several series of engine test-beds have been erected, and it is believed that UntertÜrkheim now represents one of the principal production centres for Daimler-Benz engines. </Aircraft_and_Aero-Engines><Engineering_and_Armaments> Daimler-Benz A.G. UntertÜrkheim (1) Owing to its interests in other industries (particularly the aero-engine industry - see aoove) the Daimler-Benz company is the largest motor-vehicle concern in Germany. In terms of output the UntertÜrkheim plant is second only to Opel, its 1938 production figures being 20,000 passenger cars and 6,000 commercial .vehicles. There is reason to believe that the manufacture of commercial vehicles, particularly lorries, has increased considerably in the course of the war, and that there has been a corresponding decline in the output of cars, production of which is confined mainly to military types. Several sections of the UntertÜrkheim plant are engaged on the manufacture of components for motor vehicles, which are partly supplied to <pb n="662" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454822"/> their branch works at Gaggenau and Sindelfingen.

A second works in this area is in the middle of Stuttgart (west of the main railway station) but although it has been repeatedly extended since 1939 it is not as important as the Feuerbach works. The outstanding value of the Bosch works to the German armament industry is their very large output of fuel injection pumps, magnetos, sparking plugs, and batteries, as well as the usual Bosch range of electrical accessories for internal combustion engines. In addition the Feuerbach and Stuttgart works make a wide range of other electrical appliances such as components for search- lights, head-lamps,etc., but there are, of course, only of secondary importance. Bosch operate a subsidiary factory at Klein-Machnow near and also an affiliated factory in G-erman occupied territory but it is estimated that the Stuttgart factories of Bosch still account for more than half of Germany's total requirements of fuel injection pumps, magnetos, sparking plugs, and other electrical accessories for internal combustion engines.

It was originally a repair and testing station, and is believed to have been inactive during part of 1943' probably for the purpose of conversion of many of the existing installations. In the course of 1943 the final assembly of JV/. 190's was taken up and has since reached a considerable scale. After damage to the Arado components factories at Warnemhnde and Anklam, it is believed that Tutow has taken over part of the work formerly done , at Marienburg. Components are probably drawn from Kreising and Posen, which formerly supplied Marienburg, as well as from the reconstructed plants at Warnenüinde and Anklam.

It lies on the left bank of the Danube and on the main railway line fron Stuttgart to Augsburg and Munich. It is the Junction for an important branch line leading South to Friedrichshafen, and for three minor branch lines serving the surrounding district. The central area of the town is dominated by the famous "Munster” which is believed to be the largest Gothic Cathedral in the world; its steeple is 528 feet high and it is thus the highest steeple in Europe. The most important industrial undertaking in Ulmis the Magirus A.G. This fiim specialises in fire-fighting equipment, but has now also attained a high degree of importance as a producer of A.F.V‘s and heavy aimoured vehicles. There is a non-ferrous metal fabricating plant, which is described below, and several other engineering works, some of which are working exclusively for Magirus. There is also a small textile and leather industry. The Messerschnitt aircraft assembly works at Leipheim 10 miles east of Ulm, are included in the list given below. </Description><Transportation> Railway Centre Ulm (2) The main railway line from Stuttgart enters Ulm from the North-east and, after curving Southwards, passes through the main railway station, which is on the western side of the central city area, crosses the Danube and leads in an easterly direction to Augsburg and Munich. A branch line from Signaringen and South-western Württemberg enters the city area from the North-west and Joins the Stuttgart line immediately north of the main railway station. The direct line from Ulm to Friedrichshafen diverges from the Munich route between the main station and the railway bridge and leads south-westwards along the left lead from Ulm North-east to Heidenheim and South along the River Ille to Memmingen. Marshalling Yards Ulm (3) The chief marshalling yards are to the North-west of the main railway station and inside the main curve made by the railway line from Signarlngen before it enters the central city area. They are capable of handling up to 2,400 wagons per 24 hours. There is a large goods station adjacent to these marshalling yards and a second smaller goods station half a mile to the East alongside the line to Stuttgart. Railway Repair Shops Ulm (3) The railway repair shops, which are at the Eastern end of the marshalling yards, <pb n="684" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454845"/> are "believed to undertake the repair of goods wagons and other rolling stock.

It is on the river Blau, a small tributary stream which flows through the city and joins the Danube near the Ulm railway station. An indoor substation connects the station by a 55-kV long-distance line to the RWE substation at Herbertingen for the main purose of importing rather than exporting electricity. Supplies are given locally to consumers in the Ulm area.

In 1943 the output at Leipheim was reported as 10 Me. 323's per month, and in addition the repair of an average of three gliders per week. Sane 1500 workers were said to be engaged in June 1943, but later reports suggest that this number had been increased. Reconnaissance photographs taken at the end of April 1944 showed considerable bomb damage and for the first time Me. 262 fighters were identified at this works.

In 1936 the firm was taken over by the Klockner- Humboldt- Deutz concern and the former Magirus company was liquidated. It is, however, still usual to refer to the works in Ulm as the Magirus Werke. In addition to their normal fire-fighting equipment, they are now believed to have taken up the production of AF.V's or tanks on a large scale, and a number of reports indicate that Magirus has become a highly important supplier of heavy armaments. Magirus have two works in Ulm proper (WerkI and Werk II)and a third large plant has now been established in Neu Ulm, the quarter of the town which lies on the right bank of the Danube. The works referred to as Werk I are in the Schillerstrasse close to the railway bridge across the Danube. The second works are in the Bl^ubeurenstrasse in the Western suburb of Söflingen. They occupy a large area South of the Western end of the marshalling yards and are bisected by the small stream know as the Blau which flows through the town and into the Danube near the railway bridge. There are several other factories (saw mills, roof-felting makers, a rayon mill, and a fertiliser factory)grouped round the Magirus works area. It is <pb n="686" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454847"/> thought probable that these twooriginal works (Werk I and Werk II)are still mainly engaged on theproduction of fire-engines andequipment, particularly in view ofthe severe damage to Metz of Karls-ruhe, and that the A.F.V's or tankproduction is carried out mainlyby the new works in the Neu Ulm area.One report, however, indicates thatsome of the tanks are assembled atWerk II. Other products of thisUlm factory are reported to be Dieselengines, lorries, light transport-column vehicles, tractors, smoke-screen devices, propellers andshafts and other components formidget submarines. Reports suggestthat in 1945 chenillettes, smalltracked vehicles for reconnaissance,were being turned out.

Waldshut occupies a central position in the chain of electric power stations which form the Upper Rhine hydro scheme. A second hydro scheme utilises the water of the Schluchsee, which lies 12 miles North of Waldshut. Both these electric power stations are described below under P. U. S. </Description><Public_Utility_Services> Hydro Scheme Upper Rhine (1) The Upper Rhine hydro scheme utilises the water-power resources of. a 90- miles stretch of the River Rhine between the Schaffhausen Rhine falls and Basle. This scheme embraces a system of 15 hydro electric power stations of which some are under Swiss control. Waldshut lies geographically in the centre of this chain öf stations. The German- controlled stations are Rheinau (35 MW), Eglisau (35 MW), Reckingen (36 MW), Waldshut- Kadelburg (37 MW), Albbruck-Dogern (72 MW), Laufenburg (68 MW), Säckingen (45-75 MW), Riburg-Schwttrstadt (104 MW), Rheinfelden (65 MW), and Augst-Wyhlen (51 MW). The Swiss- controlled stations are Schaffhausen (16 MW), Rheinfall (100 MW), Beznau (25 W), Klingnau (35 MW), and Birsfelden near Basle (50 mW). Special features of this hydro scheme are the unusually constant flow of Lake Constance, and the fact that the maximum flow is in July, and the minimumin Februa, ry, owing to the freezing in winter of the hi^i Alpine water sources which feed this part of the river. It is thus possible to maintain a high electrical output all the year round, with a maximum value in summer, when most other hydro schemes are obliged to operate with reduced output. <pb n="698" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454860"/> The scheme has been jointly developed by the German and Swiss Governments. The total installed capacity is 447 MW, of which the German share is 224 and the Swiss 223 MW. Hydro Scheme Schluchsee (1) The Schluchsee hydro scheme in the Black Forest is designed for an ultimate capacity of approximately 400 MW. When fully developed it will use the 1,970 ft. head between the Schluchsee lake and the River Rhine at Waldshut, a distance of 12 miles. The work was planned in three stages. Stage one included the damming of the Schluchsee, creation of a reservoir of 108 million tons capacity, a.nd the huildi ng of a pumpedr-storage station at Häusern for a head of 660 ft. Stage two was the building of a pumped-storage station at Witznau for a head of 930 ft. Stage three, which is still projected, is the building of a pumped- storage station at Waldshut for a head of 380 ft. Below Häusern and Witznau generating stations there are two reservoirs of 1.3 and 4.5 million tons capacity respectively, to . serve as daily and weekly storage basins. In 1929 construction was begun on the first stage (Hausern)and on a provisional compensat- ing station at Eichholz. This work was completed in 1933, the installed capacity of the generating plant at Hauserh being 104 MW. and at Eichholz 30 MW. In 1938 construction was begun on the second stage (Witznau), the intention being to close down Eichholz when this was completed. It is believed that this work was finished in 1942, the installed capacity of the generating plant at Witznau being approximately 176 MW, and the total for the scheme as then developed 280 MW. The scheme provides for maximum output in the winter months, and is designed to compensate for the reduced output of the Upper Rhine stations when the Alpine water supplies are frozen. The projected pumped-storage station, which has yet to be built at Waldshut, is planned to have a capacity of 100 MW. Substation Tiengen (-) The precise position of this important sub- station is unknown. It is the main collecting point for the surplus output of the Upper Rhine and Schluchsee water-power scheme, and is also the terminus of the 380/220 kV long- distance line connecting the hydro-electric stations of the Upper Rhine and Vorarlberg to the Ruhr industrial area via Herbertingen, Hoheneck, Rheinau, Kelsterbach, Koblenz, and Brauweiler substations, a distance by this route of 360 miles. Three 110 kV lines connect to Albbruck-Dogern, and two connect possibly to Klingau, two to Häusern power station, and two possibly to Berau switching station. <pb n="699" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454861"/> </Public_Utility_Services><Chemicals_and_Explosives> Lonza Waldshut (3) The Lonza Elektrochemische Fabriken G.m.b.H. are a subsidiary of the Swiss company of the same name at Campe 1.

N. T, manufacturing unit has been removed. The nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine plants do not appear to have been much altered, and there appears to be some capacity for the manufacture of finished propellant powders. In 1938 it was reported that the Reinsdorf factory produced 15,000 tons of nitro-cellulose per annum, which is a little below the estimate of capacity made by the Armistice Commission in 1919. Examination of air photographs taken in May, 1943, suggests that the nitrocellulose capacity might be- about 25,000 tons per annum at the present time. Nitroglycerine, or diglycoldinitrate, plant appears to be installed, and the capacity may be very roughly estimated at about 6,000 tons per annum. </Chemicals_and_Explosives></city><city name="WITTENBERGE"><state>Brandenburg</state><coordinates>53.,11.45</coordinates><distance> 515 miles</distance><population> 40.000</population><Description> Wittenberge is on the main railway line midway between Hamburg and Berlin.
