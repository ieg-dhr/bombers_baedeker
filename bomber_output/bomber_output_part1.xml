PART I AACHEN KÜSTRIN Enemy Branch, (Foreign Office and Ministry of Economic Warfare). <pb n="PREFACE" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454133"/> 1.	The 1944 edition of the "Bcmber's Baed revised and amplified version of Part III edition,which it replaces. It has been scope to cover all towns in Germany (re which are of any industrial significance, and it has been possible to expand the number of industrial establishments listed in each town. Information relating to the activities of particular factories has been revised in the light of the latest available intelligence. 2.	As in the previous edition, enterprises have been grouped under fourteen industrial headings as follows:- 1.	Transportation 2.	Public Utility Services 3.	Solid Fuels 4.	Liquid Fuels and Substitutes	 5.	Iron, Steel and Ferro-Alloys 6.	Non-Ferrous Metal Manufacture and Fabrication 7.	Aircraft and Aero-Engines 8.	Shipbuilding 9.	Engineering and Armaments 10.	Chemicals and Explosives 11.	Textiles, Rayon, Pulp and Paper 12.	Rubber and Tyres 13.	Leather 14.	Foodstuffs 3.	The descriptions of activities and the figures in the column entitled "Priority" are intended only as a general guide to the size and relative importance of the individual undertakings. The basis on which the "Priority" ratings have been allotted is as follows:- 1+	Factories of	outstanding importance in the German war effort. 1	Major plants	in major industries 2	Minor plants	in major industries or Major plants	in minor industries 3	Factories of	relatively small importance in the German war effort. - Factories which are almost certainly of little importance in the German war effort and establishments concerning which the available information is not sufficient to enable any priority rating to be allotted. <pb n="ii" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454134"/> Some of the works included without priority are new establishments the activities of which are uncertain; some of them would doubtless rank for inclusion in one of the four priority groups if full information were available. In allotting priorities account has been taken of the damage inflicted in area attack only in cases where the productivity of the factory concerned appears to have been permanently affected. In other cases factories are assessed on the basis that they have been fully repaired and are fully active. Owing to the speed with which repairs are put in nand in Borne cases, it did not seem practicable to give weight to damage which may prove to be temporary in assessing priorities which are intended for long-term reference. The priority rating of a factory in the Bomber's Baedeker consequently does not neoessarily reflect its current importance and should not be used for the purpose of appreciations without reference to its current damage status. If the demand from users justifies it, however, periodical statements can be issued to show the current status of damaged factories as well as other amendments. 4.	Owing to its increased size it eras been necessary to bind the new edition in two parts, of which the first includes, in alphabetical order, the towns AACHEN to KÜSTRI N. and the second the towns LAHR to ZVICKAU. Each part is accompanied by maps showing: - a)	All towns covered by the 1944 edition of the Bomber's BaedeKer. b)	The method of division of the industriell area of the Ruhr into fourteen districts. An index is in course of preparation. 5.	Enquiries relating to this report should be addressed to: - Enemy Branch (P.0. and M.E.W.) Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London,'.V.l.

It is the centre ofa large coal-mining area, and many of the companies exploiting thesemines have their administrative offices in the town. In peace-timetextiles formed the main industry in Aachen proper. There are a largenumber of spinning and weaving mills, many of which were closed earlyin the war. The leading firms of Aachen's engineering and rubberindustry are mentioned below. The town has been heavily damaged bybombing, and the production of several of these firms reduced, but muchof the industrial damage, particularly to the main factories, has beenrepaired. The industries are mainly grouped in the North East cornerof the town along the Jülicherstrasse, and in the Rothe Erde district,east of the town centre. Several of the textile mills in the Jülicher-strasse, which have been closed down, are now said to be used asdummies. The central part of the town is closely built, and has largelypreserved its mediaeval character. </Description><Transportation> Railway Junction Aachen-West (2) The main line Westwards from Cologne passes round the Southern edge of the town centre and crosses an inportant viaduct immediately to the East of the main railway station. At this station the line divides, one branch leading to Verviers and Liege, 25 miles: West of Aachen, and the second leading , Northwards round the town centre to the Aachen-West Station, near to Which, a second important track leads by another route to Liege. From the Aachen-West Station, a main line leads North East to Krefeld and the Ruhr. These are the trunk lines which , connect the industrial Rhineland direct with Antwerp and, through the Meuse valley, with North Eastern France. Further inportant branch lines lead from Aachen North East to Maastricht and Holland, and, from the Nord- bahnhof Station, to Jülich and the coal mining region to the North East of the town. Marshalling Yards Aachen-West (2) Immediately to the North West of the Aachen- West Railway Station is the largest of the town's goods yards, with marshalling yairds capable of handling 3,000 wagons per 24 hours. There are other goods stations immediately to the West of the main railway station, and in the Rothe Erde district to the East of the town. <pb n="2" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454136"/> Railway Repair Shops Aachen-West (2) These are medium-sized repair shops under- taking the repair of goods wagons.

The suburbs and built-up area extends from East to West for some20 miles:, and from North to South approximately 17 miles:. Theadministrative boundaries have been extended by the inclusion ofsurrounding districts to give a total area of 345 square miles:. The chief industrial areas lie firstly, to the North-west,including Spandau, Siemenstadt, Wedding, Tegel, and Reinickendorf,and secondly, to the South and South-east including Marienfelde,Tempelhof, and Johannistal. There are other well-establishedindustrial areas, such as Lichtenberg and Schöneberg, which arerespectively in the eastern and southern quarters of the city.Further industrial extension is taking place in various outlyingportions of the administrative area. The course of the river Spree, which' is navigable, runs approx-imately from South-east to North-west through the centre of the city.At Spandau it joins the Havel, which flows from North to South alongthe western border of Berlin. The Teltow canal, which leaves theSpree near Treptow and runs through the Southern outskirts of GreaterBerlin, joins the Havel near Potsdam and forms a link to relieve thewater-borne traffic through the centre of the city. Great use has been made of the waterways around Berlin in orderto connect the capital with the Elbe and the Oder, Large inlandharbours have been constructed. The most important of which is theWesthafen, where 70 large ships can be loaded simultaneously. TheWesthafen is connected with the Spree and with the Havel, which itjoins at Spandau. From the Havel (North-west of Berlin)shipcanals have been built giving direct access in the East to the Oder,and in the West to the Elbe. By this means navigable waterwaysconnect Berlin directly with Stettin and the Baltic, and withHamburg. The main railway artery between Western and North-easternEurope runs through Berlin. There are three large railway stationson this East to West line. In addition main lines radiate from fiveother terminal railway stations to all parts of Germany. The localand suburban traffic is served by the electric Stadt- und Ringbahn,the extensive network of which extends over the whole area. This issupplemented by the large system of the Hoch- und Untergrundbahn,which runs partly underground and partly as an elevated railway, and'by the tramway and bus services.All the leading firms have administrative offices in Berlin.These are largely concentrated in the central city area betweenAlexanderplatz and the Eastern end of Unter den Linden, and also inthe neighbourhood of the Potsdamnerplatz. Running South from the Western end of Unter den Linden is theWilhelmstrasse, in which are situated the Chancellery, the War Office,the Air Ministry and other Government departments. <pb n="32a" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454167"/> The principal shopping centres of Berlin, which contain severallarge department stores, are Leipzigerstrasse, Alexanderplatz, andTauentzienstrasse, in Charlottenburg.Industries The firmly established and significant position held by theindustries of Berlin within the German productive machine is primarilydue to their scope and diversity, both of which have been furtherdeveloped during the war. The electro-technical industry (including radio)still maintainsits important and leading position and is represented by large firmsof world-wide repute such as the A. E. G., Siemens and Halske A. G.,Siemens Schuckert A.G., and Telefunken Ges. fur Drahtlose Telegraphiem.b.H., Osram G.nub.H., and others. The general engineering industry is also of substantial import-ance, as is shown by the well-known firms engaged in it, such asRheinmetall Borsig A.G., Ambi-Budd Presswerke G.nub.H., DeutscheIndustriewerke A. G., Berliner Maschinenbau A. G.‘ (vormals L. Schwartzkopff),and Daimler-Benz A.G.; it. is, in fact, Berlins second-largest branchof industry. The aircraft industry is represented by E:M.W.,Dornier, He ink el. and Focke-Wulf, and general engineering by numerousmakers of precision tool and of precision and optical instruments. Berlin's chemical, clothing, and food industries, are also ofmore than local importance.Industrial Areas The chief industrial areas are located outside the Ringbahn,along the water and railway routes. These routes are arranged inthree main belts:- the river Spree and the canals associated with it;the railway which encircles the outskirts of the compact built-uparea, i. e., the Ringbahn; and an outer ring of conmunications whichconsist of the Havel and Tegel See to the West, the Teltow canalfrom Potsdam to Kopenick to the South, and the Industrie Bahn to theNorth from Tegel to Lichtenberg. An important feature of the three outstanding industrial areasis that there .are only small residential areas in their immediatevicinity. In order of importance these are:-Spandau, Charlottenburg, and Siemenstadt. (1) This west-central part of Berlin is of the highest importance..Here there are very big blocks of factory buildings and also aspecial port. Among others, the electrical equipment and cableworks of Siemens and Halske A.G., Siemens Schuckert A.G., A.E.G. .Turbinenfabrik, the Ges. fur Elektrische Unternehmungen L. Loewe A.G.,Osram G.m.b.H., and the E:M.W. are located there. The second andthird largest of the BEWAG power stations are also in this area.Treptow and Schöneweide' (2) The manufacture of elect ideal equipment of all kinds is pre-dominant within this area, and, although the A.E.G. has its largestindividual plant at Brunnenstrasse, Wedding, the three most importantelectrical equipment and cable works of the company are to be foundhere. The most important of Berlin's non-ferrous metal plants andthe main works of the important Accumulateren Fabrik A.G. (A. F.A.) <pb n="33" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454168"/> are located in the Schöneweide district. There are other engin-eering works, motor vehicle and metal works. The largest of theBEWAGpowerstationsisatRummelsburg, near theTreptowarea. Tegel, Wittenau, and Reinickendorf. (3) Important engineering and armament-production plants are to befound here. The most prominent of these are the Dornier and theHeinkel air-craft-components factories, the Argus aero-engine factory,Maschinenfabrik Prometheus G.nub.H., and the Deutsche Waffen- undMunitions- Fabriken A.G-. To the North there are many snail and scattered factories, thechief of which are at Lichtenberg, where Siemens Planiawerke and anumber of other engineering woiks are located. To the South, atMariendorf, Tempelhof and Britz, the chief factories lie on theSouth side of the Tempelhof airfield. Industries are also to befound on the Eastern outskirts of Neukolln. The suburban areas, most of which lie far outside Berlin, havebeen developed mainly during the last twenty years. As a rule theyare largely residential, but in some cases industrial developmenthas taken place. The greatest extensions have been made along therailways to the North-west towards Hennigsdorf and Oranienburg; tothe North-east to Bernau: to the East beyond Mahlsdorf: to theSouth-east beyond Kopenick to Wildau; to the South to Lichtenrade:and to the South-west around the South of the Havel See to Potsdam. </Description><Transportation> a) West Harbour West Harbour (1) b)East Harbour East Harbour (1) c) Spandau-South Harbour Spandau-South Harbour (3) Berlin is second only to Duisburg as an inland port.

ELECTRICITY SUPPLY Abbreviations BKL (BE.7AG).....Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG)- A.G. EWAG.............Elektrowerke A.G. MEW. ............MÄrkisches Elektrizitätswerk A. G. ESA..............Elektrizitätswerk Südwest A.G. General The city is supplied from external sources chiefly by the EWAG and the MEW systems. The BKL (BEWAG)con- trols all the main power stations in the city. The total capacity of the generating stations is 1,250 mW. External Supply There are two main outside systems of supply to the city. The first, the EWAG system, supplies current from GoIpa-Zschornewitz and Trattendorf. These lines enter Berlin at Spandau and at Rummelsburg and thence are linked up to the BKL (BEWAG)system. Two lines come from Trattendorf; one skirts the northern suburbs and enters at Spandau, the other connects with BKL (BEWAG) system at Friedrichsfelde. The other is the MEW system, which encircles Berlin and introduces current from the power stations at Finkenheerd, Finow, and Hennigsdorf. Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG)- A.G. "Deutsche Edison" was founded in 1883 and in the following year was granted a concession to supply electrical current to part of the city of Berlin. This concession was transferred to the Städtische Elektrizi- tätswerke on its formation. Later, this company became the Berliner Elektrizitätswerke (BEW), and the concession was extended to cover the whole of the city of Berlin. In 1915 the city itself took over the direction of the firm under the name Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Berlin (STEW), but this was again altered in 1923 to Berliner Städtische Elektrizitätswerke Akt. Ges. (BEWAG). In 1931 the Berliner Kraft- und Licht-Aktiengesell- schaft (BKL)was formed to administer the electrical installations owned directly by the city and those owned by BEWAG. The BEWAG capital was transferred to the new company and two other Berlin companies - Elektrowerke A.G. (EWAG)and Preussische Elektrizitäts Aktiengesellschaft- also became shareholders of the new company. Finally, in 1934, BEWAG and BKL were completely amalgamated to form the present Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG)- A.G. In 1938, BKL (BEWAG)- the new company - acquired the firm of Elektrizitätswerk Südwest A. G. (ESA)and so widened its territorial interests to Schöneberg, Wilmersdorf and <pb n="35" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454174"/> P. U. S. (Electricity) Schmargendorf. In the same year, as a result of an agreement made in 1928. it acquired from Mftrkisches Elektrizitätswerk A.G.(MEW)territorial interests in Dahlem, Lankwitz, Lichtenrade, Mariendorf, Südende, and Tempelhof, Thus BKL (BEWAG )acquired the interests in the whole of the city as far as the small outlying districts of Wannsee and Buch. The company claims that this is the largest system of electrical manufacture and distribution in any one city in the world. BKL (BEWAG-) power station Klingenberg (1+) This is the largest of the thermal power stations owned by the Berliner Kraft- und Licht (BEWAG)-A.G. , which supply electricity to the Berlin area. Built in 1926/28, it operates on base load and has an in- stalled capacity of 270 MW. but is designed for an ultimate capacity of 540 MW. It is situated on the North bank of the river Spree in the South-east of the city on a site of 50'acres; the main control room for the BKL (BEWAG ) systemis in the nine-storied office block which also houses large water tanks on its top floor. From a 30 kV switch house at least 48 three-phase . 30 kV underground cables are operated in pairs and are connected to different substations in the Berlin area. There is also a 30 kV connection to the adjacent 81 MW, Rummelsburg station. BKL (BEWAG) power station Berlin-West (1+) This station is the second largest of the BKL (BEWAG) system and has an installed capacity of 228 MW. Built in 1929/1932, it is situated on the North bank of the river Spree in the western area of the city near the Siemens works at Siemenstadt. It was originally operated mainly to supply part of the Berlin day load, the night load being supplied by the Klingenberg station and by long-distance transmission from the large brown-coal-fired stations at Golpa-Zschomewitz, Trattendorf, Lauta, Finkenheerd, and elsewhere. The small Unterspree power station is situated 300 yards to the South-west, on the bank of the Spree. The main supply at 30 kV from the station is through underground cables to the Berlin city network via the 30 kV switch house. Supplies are also given direct to the nearby Siemens works. In addition to auxiliary supplies some small local supplies are probably given at 6, J kV via the 6. J kV switch house. BKL (BEWAG) power station . Charlottenburg (1) This thermal power station, owned by BKL (BEWAG), has an installed capacity of 109 MW. Built, in 1900, it was completely reconstructed in 1925 in two sections, of which one, with a capacity of 59 MW. , operates on base load, while the other plant, which has a capacity of₅d 50 mW. , meets the peak load. It is situated in the western area of the city, on the North bank of the <pb n="36" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454175"/> BKL (BEWAG) power station (contd.) Charlottenburg (1) river Spree. There is a 30 kV substation con- taining twelve 6/30 kV transformers of a total capacity of 116 MW. and one 30/3 kV inter-bus transformer of 8 MW. capacity. Local supplies are connected by underground cables to Spandau, Knie, the Siemens works, Moabit, and to the nearby 1Ö0 kV. substation. The 100 kV substation connected the Berlin 30 kV underground cable system with the 100 kV transmission system. One 100 kV line goes to Spandau, 6 miles: to the North- west, and one to Moabit, from there continuing to Friedrichsfelde substation (9 miles: East of Charlottenburg). The electrical output is supplied to Berlin. Steamis also supplied at 281 lbs/sc. in. for a district-heating system. BKL (BEWAG) power station Rummelsburg (1) This station is situated in Rtmmelsburg, a suburb in the South-east of Berlin, on the North bank of the river Spree within J mile of the Klingenberg station and has an installed capacity of 81 W. A 100/30 kVA substation close to the generating plant transforms 100 kV supplies from the EWAG grid to 30 kV for local distribution. One 100 kV double-circuit line goes to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 4 miles: to the North, and one to Golpa-Zschomewitz. The substation serves for local distribution at 30 kV rather than for supplying electricity externally. A 6/30 kV substation connects the 100/30 kV sub- station to the generating station, and contains at least two 6/30 kV transformers each of 18 MW. capacity)it connects the generating station to the 30 kV grid of the Berlin area and with the 100/30 kV substation it also serves for local distribution at 6 kV. BKL (BEWAG) power station Moabit (2) This is one of the oldest stations of the BKL (BEWAG)system supplying the Berlin area and has an installed capacity of 81 MW. It is operated for peak load and standby purposes. It is situated in the North-west central district on the Schiffahrts-Kanal and consists of 2 parts; these are composed of a large number of reconditioned old units or replacements, which made identification of plant difficult. A substation for 100/30 kV' steps down the supplies received through the 100 kV grid for distribution over the Berlin 30 kV grid. The substation is partly open air and partly in the old engine house; it contains at least 5 transformers each of 16 MW. Long distance 100 kV lines pass to Spandau, 7 miles: distant, and to the Friedrichsfelde substation, 8 miles: East of Moabit. A 6/30 kV substation gives supplies to the Berlin 30 kV grid. Local distribution is also at 6 kV. <pb n="37" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454176"/> BKL (BEWAG) power station Wilmersdorf (2) This station on the BKL (BEWAG)systemis situated, at Wilmersdorf, a South-western suburb of Berlin close to the Rudolsthd ter st rasse, and has an installed, capacity of 62 MW. This station was built by ESA in about 1905 and supplies the South-western area of Berlin. It is believed that the Wilmersdorf station is now used by BKL (BEWAG)for standby purposes only. An A.C./D.C. converter plant is attached to the station. The city of Berlin is supplied at 6.6. kV and at lower voltages, and supplies are also given to the underground railways. It is possible that this station has been connected by BKL (BEWAG)to the 30 kV Berlin grid and that a 30/6 kV substation has been added to serve as a local distribution centre. BKL (BEWAG) power station Spandau (1) This station on the BKL (BEWAG)systemis situated on the Havel See near Spandau, a North-west suburb of Berlin and has an installed capacity of 56 MW. The generating plant is used for standby and peak load only. One double ciruit line goes to Trattendorf, one to Brandenburg (there connecting to Golpa- Zschomewitz and Diesdorf), and one to Charlottenburg. There is a 100 kV connection to Henningsdorf (5 miles: to the North). Local supplies are given at 6 kV, and to the Berlin grid at 30 kV. This station contains one of the main substations in Berlin. It has at least two 100/30 kV transformers, each of 16 MW. capacity and transforms the supplies received from the 100 kV grid to 30 kV for local distribution. It is the terminus of the 220 kV line which was partially constructed before the war and is now probably completed; starting at Brauweiler, the line reaches Spandau via Koepehenwerk, Bielefeld, Lehrte, Harbke, Diesdorf (Magdeburg), and Brandenburg; a distance of 385 miles: by this route. EWAG switch station Friedrichsfelde (2) This important switch station is owned, by EWAG and is situated on the east side, of the city. Two 100 kV lines from Golpa-Zschomewitz and Trattendorf power stations pass to Berlin. It is also connected to the Moabit and Rummelsburg transforming stations. The elimination of this station would seriously affect the citys external supplies and it is, there- fore, an important target. <pb n="37a" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454177"/> BKL (BESAG) power station Unterspree (3) This station on the BKL (BEWAG) systemis situated on the South bank of the river Spree opposite to the Berlin-West station, and has an installed capacity of 36 MW. It supplies the underground railway system. BKL (BESAG) power station Schöneberg (3) This station, built by ESA, is now on the BKL (BEWAG) system and is situated in the Schöneberg district, to the South of the city and 2 miles: East of the Wilmersdorf station. It is a reserve plant and has an installed capacity of 20 MW. BKL (BEWAG) power station Oberschönenweide (3) This station had a capacity of 36 MW. It was closed do-wn in 1933 and converted to a 30/6 kV transformer station. <pb n="38" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454178"/> P. U. S. II GAS SUPPLY General Up to 1939 gas supply in Berlin was undertaken by two companies, the Berliner Städtische Gaswerke A.G, , with works at Charlottenburg Danziger Str. Lichtenberg .Neukölln Tegel leased to the company by the Municipality, and the Gasbetriebs- gesellschaft A.G, , a subsidiary of the Deutsche Gasgesellschaft A.G. , with works atGitschinerstr.

The town's only industries are a few small leather works, none of which are worthy of note. BRAUNSCHWEIG (Brunswick) Braunschweig, or Brunswick, on the river Oker, is the chief town of the State of the same name. It is situated on the fertile plain North of the Hartz Mountains and lies in the rich agricultural district of the Aller basin. The town is the principal marketing centre for the corn, sugar, vegetables and cattle of the area. The inner town is a well preserved survival of mediaeval days with many half-timbered houses. In early years Brunswick was a road Junction on the trade route from Hamburg to Southern Germany and the town still retains its importance as a comaunioations centre. It is on the railway midway between Magdeburg and Hannover with through connections to the Baltic and North Sea coast. Brunswick is linked by its harbour with the Mittelland Canal and thus has direct access to Germany r extensive inland waterways system. Formerly Brunswick's chief speciality was the preservation of foodstuffs and it is still an important supplier of the armed forces. <pb n="92" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454232"/> The town has, however, now become of outstanding importance owing to the development of the aircraft and engineering industries. There are two large aircraft works in the town and two equally important works in the outlying districts of Querum and Waggum which lie within the administrat- ive area. The industrial plants in Brunswick are mainly grouped in the southern quarter of the town in the neighbourhood of the railway yards and in the northern outskirts where there are several factories chiefly engaged in engineering. Shortly before the war the Hermann Goring concern erected a huge steel plant in the village of Hallendorf some 8 miles: South West of Brunswick. This plant is one of the largest of its kind in the Reich and the industrial importance of Brunswick increased still further after its construction. For this reason these works are included in the targets listed below, although they are situated well beyond the boundaries of the town. The plant is extensively provided with road and rail communications linking it through Brunswick with other parts of Germany. </Description><Transportation> Inland Port Veltenhof (3) Some two miles: North of Brunswick and included in the town adminis- trative area is the village of Veltenhof near which is situated a small inland port.

From Danzig the Vistula flows northwards into the Baltic.Neufahrwasser the outer port of Danzig, is on the left bank close tothe mouth of the river. In the northern quarter of Danzig proper, along the banks of theVistula, are the important Schichau and Danziger Werft ship buildingyards. A cut-off in the river Vistula, known as the Kaiserhafen andabout 1^ miles: long, stretches from the Eastern end of the ship buildingarea across a bend in the Vistula, which it rejoins halfway betweenDanzig and the river mouth. The port of Danzig with its ship buildingand ship repairing activities, extends alongside these two waterways.The principal docks are in the Holm, the island formed by the Kaiserhafenand the bend of the Vistula. The town itself is divided by the stream of the Mott lau, atributary of the Vistula. The north-west quarter constitutes the oldcity, with the main railway station on its western border. Two branchesof the railway run from the main station west of the river Vistula toNeufahrwasser. A separate branch leaves the main line south of Danzig,encircles the city to the east, and serves the ports on the Kaiserhafenand the Holm Island as well as the railway repair shops on the right bankof the river. There are a number of large flour mills and various industries inthe central city area and in the Niederstadt (the south-east quarter ofthe town) but it is as a ship and submarine building centre and as anaval and submarine base and arsenal that Danzig occupies a position ofmajor importance. </Description><Transportation> Marshalling Yards Kaiserhafen (3) Railway Repair Shops Kaiserhafen (2) These extensive yards and installations are on the right bank of the Vistula near to the Southern end of the Kaiserhafen. The railway sidings serving the quays and docks of the port area radiate from here. It is estimated that 2,000 workers are employed in the repair shops which before the war were the chief locomotive and rolling stock works supplying the Polish rail- ways. Ground intelligence suggests that in 1942 about 1,800 workers were employed, and that this plant was principally engaged on repair and maintenance of main line loconatives.Goods Station Olivaer Tor (3) Immediately north of the main railway station are large marshalling and goods yards from which the branch lines radiate to the Schichau and the Danziger Werft ship building yards.Repair Shops Werftgasse (3) The railway repair works of the Danziger Werft and Eisenbahnwerkstatten A.G. are between the <pb n="128" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454268"/> Olivaer Tor goods yards and Danziger .verft ship building yards.

There are six main slipways, three of them 700 feet long. The yards are equipped for the construction of large merchant ships and tankers and all kinds of ship repair. They build submarines, and in 1943 were reported to be completing three monthly. They have also undertaken construction of floating docks and three of these, each with lifting capacity of 20,000 tons, were turned out during the early months of 1943 Danziger Werft Danzig (1) The second large Danzig ship building oonem is also in the northern part of the city further upstream from and almost adjacent to the Schiohau works. The yards of the Danziger Werft A.G-. are on both banks of the Vistula, the area on the southern bank being the larger of the two. Their capacity is similar to that of Schichau and they are also constructing submarines. Assault craft have been reported to be a speciality of these yards. WoJan Schiffswerft Troyl (3) Klawitter Schiffswerft Strohdeich (3) These are two minor ship yards probably engaged on building and repair of small coastal vessels. Klawitter is on the tongue of land on the right bank of the Mottlau where it Joins the Vistula, and Wo J an is on the opposite bank of the Vistula near the suburb of Troyl. Naval Base Der Holm (1) The chief naval establishment and arsenal are on the Holm Island, where there are two large and several smaller docks. The submarines using this harbour are moored along the bank of the Kaiserhafen where two or three large ships are permanently moored to serve as living quarters. There are a large nuriber of buildings on the Holm serving as naval supply sheds and oil storage. Close to the south end of the Kaiserhafen several buildings of cement have been constructed on the Holm which are thought to be submarine pens or repair installations. <pb n="130" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454270"/> </Shipbuilding><Chemicals_and_Explosives> Miloh A.G.

It is traversed from South to North by the Rhine, on the Westof which is flat lightly-wooded country with scattered villages andsmall towns, lying at the general level of 75 to 100 feet above sealevel. On the Bast of the Rhine the country is much more thicklypopulated and rises eastwards to about 200 feet, except in the gapthrough which run the River Ruhr and the Rhine-Herne canal. Tothe North and South are extensive forests. Duisburg is by far the largest town in this district with apopulation of nearly 440,000 (including Hamborn). It lies on bothsides of the mouth of the river Ruhr and includes the townships ofRuhrort, Hamborn, Wanheimerort, Hückingen, Rheinhausen, Wedau,Grosseribaum and Dinslaken' Duisburg owes its industrial importance and prosperity to thepresence, in its immediate vicinity, of hard coal in very consid-erable quantities This has accounted for the development ofiron and steel, heavy engineering, and other industries and broughtabout the necessity for construction and repeated expansion of theDuisburg-Ruhrort Harbour situated at the mouth of the river Ruhr. Duisburg' s situation at the confluences of the rivers Rhineand Ruhr and in the centre of the western concentration of the Ruhrindustrial area gives it great importance from the point of view oftransportation. Its main claim to fame is that it is here morethan anywhere else in the Ruhr or Rhineland that the transfer ofgoods from rail to water or water to rail takes place, and it isthis factor that has made Duisburg the greatest inland waterwayharbour in Europe. The railway network at Duisburg has been constructed primarilyto provide ample facilities to deal with the rail traffic origin-ating from, or destined for the waterways; this function is fulfilledby the extensive marshalling yards at Ruhrort Hafen Neu Schultenhof,which handled about 14 million tons of traffic annually before thew ar. a second - and scarcely less important - function of thesystemis to accommodate the North-South and the West-East flow ofland traffic; this is achieved by the marshalling yards at Duisburgmain station, and, amongst others, those at Oberhausen West in theNorth-East (see under "Oberhausen), at Wedau to the South-East,and at Hohenbudberg on the left bank of the river Rhine (see under"Uerdingen"). In addition, Duisburg lies on the Rhine-Herne Canal, whichleaves the Rhine at this point and Joins the Dortmund-Ems Canal nearDatteln and thus links Duisburg by waterway with the North Sea atBnden and the Mittelland Canal at Bevergern. There are two harboursto deal with the waterborne traffic, which consists in the main ofcoal, coke, and finished iron and steel goods (outwards): iron-ore,grain and timber (inwards); the harbours are ajso important forstorage reasons.

G., and is quite near the Knlmmel factory, with which it is associated. In the last war the Duneberg factory was Germany's largest producer of nitro- cellulose and nitroglycerine Most of this production was sent to the Krümmel factory for the manufacture of powder. There has been very little ground information on the activities of this plant during the present war, and there is no air cover. Such reports as have been received Suggest that it has attained at least its former activity, and it is probable that it bears the same relation to the KXÜmmel plant as formerly' On this basis it may be assumed that the nitro- cellulose production is upwards of 36,000 tons per annum, but it would be difficult to guess the nitroglycerine or diglyooldinitrate pro- duction, since it is unlikely that Germany will have concentrated her production of this class of explosive to so great a degree as in the last war, and at least one new factory engaged in this production has been identified <pb n="178" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454318"/> Dynamit A.-G. Krümmel (1) This factory is operated by Dynamit A.G., and during the last war was the largest propellant powder factory in Germany, accounting for nearly one-third of the total German output of cordite, and also accounting for about 10 per cent, of the total German production of Nitrocellulose. In the peace years this factory was allowed to continue operations, manufacturing small quantities of nitroglycerine (probably for mining ejqplosives); it also introduced, strangely enough, the production of T. N. T. on a small scale (a little over 1,000 tons a year), and engaged in the production of nitrocellulose for celluloid and synthetic fibre production. There is very little information regarding the activities of the Krttamel factory in the present war, but it is clear that a very large labour force is now employed. Apart, however, from a report that its nitroglycerine or diglycol dinitrate production approaches 5000 tons per annum, which is roughly the same as the production in the last war, there is little information as to its output. On the basis of the nitroglycerine or diglycoldinitrate output, it seems likely that this factory has achieved at least its last war importance, and may have considerably exceeded it. This would indicate a nitrocellulose output of about 20,000 tons a year. The factory lies on the banks of the Elbe, east of the village of Geesthacht. There is also probably a large propellant powder plant on this site. <pb n="179" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454319"/> </Chemicals_and_Explosives></city><city name="DÜSSELDORF"><state>RHINELAND</state><coordinates>51.15,6.50</coordinates><distance> 500 miles</distance><population> 559.000</population><Description> The area covered here lies oa both sides of the river Rhine to thesouth-west of the Ruhr district It includes the city of Düsseldorfwith its main suburbs of Derendorf, Oberbilk and Unterbilk, Lier enfeldand Flingern and the townships of Rath' Ratingen' Gerresheim' Erkrath'Reisholz, Benrath, Nievenheim (including Stürzeiberg)Heerdt (including Niederkassel and Oberkassel) and Lohausen (including Stockum)The city of Neuss on the western bank of the Rhine is to be found underits own heading and is not included in Düsseldorf The total popula-tion for this area is 559'000 (1940) The city of Düsseldorf has a population of 528,000 (1940)and is the leading coaometcial city of western Germany Situated on theeastern bank of the Rhine, it has exceptionally good transportfacilities both by river and rail It is furthermore ₜGermany's thirdlargest inland port' and therefore of particular importance as a trans-port centre' During and after the last war' Düsseldorf developedconsiderably and so far as the production of armaments and generalengineering is concerned, it is as important as E: sen or Duisburg' Inaddition Dusseldorf is the seat of the General Administrative Departmentsof practically all the important iron and steel, heavy engineering, andarmament concerns in Rhine and Ruhr districts The distribution of industry ih the Düsseldorf area may be said to lie in 4 main areas:- i) The eastern and southern part of the city proper This is a highly concentrated area containing large engineering works, machine tool makers, wire-drawing plant, and the municipal gas and electricity works ii) The northern suburb of Derendorf and townships of Rath and Ratingen Here are to be found extensive marshalling yards and highly important armament manufacturers iii) The harbour area on the Rhine to the southwest of the city with docks, storage and engineering firms iv) South of Düsseldorf at Reishols and Benrath Engineering and chemical works, oil refinery and storage, electricity works, electric resistance wire works, lead and zinc fabricators are all grouped in this area which extends in a south-westerly and north-easterly direction and embraces the townships of Nievenheim and Erkrath </Description><Transportation>Railway Marshalling Yards.

The surrounding country is flat, andlow-lying, intersected by canals and almost entirely devoted to agri-culture. Apart fromits harbour and associated industry, Emden andthe surrounding district is not industrially significant. Itsposition, however, as a terminus of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and the Ems-Jade Canal connecting Emden with Wilhelmshaven makes it a valuableservice port for the Ruhr, particularly in the handling of Swedishiron ore for which it is specially equipped. It is also importantas a naval station, a base for mine-layers and mine-sweepers, and forits facilities for shipbuilding and ship repairs. There are four main harbours, the Outer Harbour, the inner Harbour,the N.w Inner Harbour, and the Industry Harbour. Of these, only theOuter Harbour is tidal, the others being entered from the sea, eithervia the look at the entrance to the N.w Inner Harbour, or through thatat the northern end of the Outer Harbour. The Outer Harbour iscapable of accommodating the largest sea-going vessels at its quays. The N.w Inner Harbour, in which is handled a large proportionof Emden' s traffic, is reached by the large ocean lock (260 m. longby 40 m. wide). On the south of this harbour is the Ore and IronQuay)coal and coke are also dealt with at this quay. Adjacent to the N.w Inner Harbour on the north is the IndustryHarbour with the Nordseewerke shipyard and a briquette factory.The harbour equipment includes a great variety of cranes, and goodrailway connections to the quays enable loading to be effected directiron truck to ship without the need of intermediate storage. Emden is supplied with electricity on the grid system. A grid°°d transformer station is situated at the eastern extremity of theIndustry Harbour, g small power plant on the east quay of theInner Harbour, at its southern end, supplies power for dock install-ations. Emden has no important local industries. Its value lies ratherin its trade, which causes fhe port to rank high among German seaports.It is the import and export harbour for bulk goods to and from theeastern and central Ruhr, notably serving this district with supplies <pb n="201" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454341"/> of iron ore from Sweden' There is also an active trade in agri-cultural produce, cattle, timber, coal and coke, while it was inpeace time an important base for the deep sea fishing fleet.

E: sen includes within its boundaries a number of sprawling suburbs with a total population of 670,000; the original town and surrounding villages have long since outgrown their boundaries and industrialization has given the area a character not unlike that of an English mining district. E: sen is the great armaments centre of the Ruhr. Its reputation as Germany's greatest armaments arsenal ("Die Waffenschmiede des Reichs as the Germans call it)originates from World War I in the course of which the famous Friedrich Krupp works expanded on a scale unprecedented in history. In 1917/18 a peak figure of over 150,000 workers were employed by the Fr. Krupp A.G. undertaking, some 80,000 of whom worked at the main plant at E: sen. But whereas Krupp tnrougnout the last war remained the principal producer of armaments in the Reich it had, 19 to the outbreak of World War II, to a great extent lost its dominating position in the field of German arma ents manufacture, partly as a result of the complete reorganisation of the works after the collapse of Germany's war machine in 1918 and in accordance with which several large departments were successfully switched over to commercial commodities such as locomotives, lorries, Diesel engines for heavy road transport, small ships' diesels, forged drums for high-pressure boilers, wheels and axles for locomotives, railway trucks and wagons etc., and also due to the fact that other important armaments producers, particularly the Rheinmetall Borsig works at Derendorf near Düsseldorf (20 miles: E:W. of E: sen), Germanysecond largest armaments producers in the last war, have been consider- ably extended and today are probably of equal importance as armaments makers. There is no doubt that the main E: sen works of Friedrich Krupp JUG. remained the largest individual armaments and heavy engineering plant in the Reich, but instead of being one vast arms producing centre, as was the case during the last war, it became rather a combination of factories producing a wide range of materials and articles, many of which, although of the utmost importance to Germany s war effort, are not of an armament nature. However, Krupp remains the principal if not only producer in Germany of heavy naval, coastal defence and railway guns. <pb n="208" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454348"/> It was estimated in 1942 that the total nuaber of workers andemployees operating in the various Krupp torks was 175,000. Thisnumber was divided roughly as follows: - Armaments sections of the main works at E: sen 35.000 Heavy engineering sections of the min works at E: sen. 40,000 Krupp Gruson Works at Magdeburg (armaments and heavy engineering) 35.000 Coal mines, iron-ore nines, coke-oven plants, synthetic oil plants,etc. situated at various places in Western Germany 18,000 Friedrich Alfred Hutte steelworks near Duisburg 12,000 Friedrich Krupp iron and steel works, E: sen, (situated several miles: West of the main works). 5,000 Krupp Germania Terft, Kiel, (shipbuilding yards)10,000 Administrative staff at the various works, holding and financing companies, distribution centres, trading companies, eto. 20,000175,000 At the southern boundary of the district is the River Ruhr,which is navigable by smaller barges from Duisburg to Witten,eastof E: sen. Across the centre of the area run the Enscher Canal andthe Rhine-Herne Canal. The former is used for drainage purposesand runs from Walsum on the Rhine to Dortmund. The latter is animportant connecting link between the Rhine and the Dortmund-EmsCanal; along it passes traffic which has come down the Rhine andits tributaries to Duisburg-Ruhrort and by its junction with theDortmund-Ems Canal the traffic passes on to the Mittelland Canaland so to the great towns of north Germany. Damage to any of thethree looks would therefore have a serious effect on the industriallife of a great part of the country. It will be observed that manyof the important industries of this district lie close to or onthe canal harbours. The area is provided with large marshalling yards and a networkof railways, so interconnected that it is difficult to pick outthose of outstanding importance. It is probable, however, thatthe Osterfeld Marshalling lard (see under "Oberhausen")bandies alarge proportion of the traffic between Duisburg and northern Germany.The other targetted yards in this area probably serve mainly aslocal yards. The most important electrical objective in this area is the E: sen-Karnap 220 MW. R.W.E. electric power station situated afew miles: north of E: sen. This is the most important power plantin the Ruhr industrial area. There is also a 45 MW. R.W.E.station in E: sen itself. <pb n="209" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454349"/> Although it is hardly possible to distinguish any areas as industrially more important than others, because any attempt to do so would leave out of account some very important targets, it may be said that the principal group of targets covered by this report lie within the area of E: sen proper, and stretch north-westwards from E: sen-town to the Rhine-Herne Canal. It includes the steel works of Friedrich Krupp A.G. as well as the vast arms, locomotives and general engineering works of that firm, besides large coal mines and coke-oven plants; the zinc smelters of A.G. des Altenbergs für Bergbau and Zinkhüttenbetrieb at Borbeck; the plastics works of Presswerk A.G.; the very important chemicals and non-ferrous metals works Th.Goldschmidt A.G. (now inactive, see under Non-Ferrous Metals); and finally the important railway traffic centre E: sen-Verschiebebahnhof. During 1943, the town of E: sen was largely devastated. Extremely, severe damage was inflicted on the Friedrich Krupp works and it was thought that by the end of July 1943, output had been reduced to one third of capacity. Since then, some reconstruction has taken place, and by the end of 1943 output was reckoned at 40% of pre-raid capacity. The works of Theodore Goldschmidt A.G. were also severely damaged and are believed to be inactive (see under Non-ferrous Metals) <pb n="210" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454350"/> </Description><Transportation> Bailway traffic centre.

There is a tyre-rolling plant covering 34,000 square yards,which has an annual production estimated at 315,000 "tyres and120,000 wheel centres. The numerous forges are capable of producing the largest forgingsfor guns, including the heavier naval types, parts for turbines andlocomotives, and also smaller forgings such as components for motorvehicles and aircraft. The hammer and forging shops contain 120 steamhammers and 11 steam hydraulic presses. In the largest forging shopthere are presses of 200, 400, and 500 tons capacity, and one largepress of 1500 tons capacity, which is served by two 400-ton cranesmanipulating the ingots, while another two 100-ton cranes handle thenecessary tools. Amongst the many rolling mills are those .containing drawing andflanging presses of various capacity, aggregating over 8,000 tons. There are several foundries for iron, malleable iron, rustlessand heat-resisting castings and non-ferrous castings in brass,bronzes, and aluminium- Besides these, there are numerous other shops engaged ongeneral engineering.

Examples of V.D.M products in military equipment are also known, and the company is almost certainly also making light-metal fittings for submarines. Capacity An up-to-date estimate for the capacity of the Heddernheim works is difficult to produce, especially owing to the difficulty of estimating the extent to which copper-fabricating plant in this and other works has been turned over to working on light alloys. It is known that Heddernheim had one of the best rolling mills in Germany for aluminium sheet and strip and produced about 6,000 tons per year which was about 10$ of the country's total former output. Heddernheim's capacity for the production of extruded sections is believed to have been about 4,000 tons per year or about 25$ of the total German capacity. At least 50$ of the total output was required- by the aircraft industry. It is also (after I.G' Bitterfeld) one of the two most inportant producers of wrought magnesium - alloy products. The output of complete airscrews at Heddernheim at the present time is believed to be slightly above 30$ of the total German production. <pb n="234" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454374"/> Deutsche Gold-and Silber Scheideanstalt (see under C. and E.)

Loewenthal and Allmansweiler (2) The Allmansweiler—Löwenthal plant has been devoted to final assembly, special installations, tests,.and possibly repairs of Do. 217s. In August 1943, according to a well- informed source, this unit was the oentre for the development of specialised Dornier types such as the Do. 217M, equipped with DE: 603 engines, and a high altitude reconnaissance type. At that time it was assembling 20 Do. 217s per month. Since then all <pb n="249" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454389"/> evidence points to decreased activity and recent cover of the field shows only 20 to 25 aircraft, including a number of modified types and experiment- al models. It is doubtful if new Do. 217s are being produced here at present, though repairs and the installation of special equipment may be continuing on a small scale. Interest in this plant as a target derives mainly from (1 reports that the Dornier organization and this unit in parti cular are tooling up for production of F.W. 190s, (2 reports that certain Dornier plants in the Friedrichshafen area are engaged in production of the peenemttnde 20, and (3 the possibility that this plant may resume production of Do. 217 fighters in an effort to make up losses in twin-engine fighters resulting from recent attacks on German aircraft factories and operating attrition of the GAF. Dornier Werke G'm.b.H. Manzell (2) This plant is the parent works of the Dornier conplex at Friedrichshafen. A year ago it was engaged in experimentat- ion and development of new Dornier types, the production of Do 217 components for assembly at Allmansweiler/LBwenthal, and possibly some seaplane development and assembly. The nature and scale of the plant's activities at present can only be inferred' from the accumulation of existing ground reports. This intelligence is sunsnarized below: i) There is no evidence that seaplanes are being assembled, though the plant probably serves as a seaplane base and may continue to do experimental work on Dornier seaplanes. ii) Manufacture of Do 217 components may be continuing on a reduced, scale. The total output of Do 217 s in all three complexes is not believed at present to exceed 20 per month. <pb n="250" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454390"/> ill) With other plants in the Friedrichshafen district, Domer at Manzell may contribute in some way to the production of pilotless aircraft. Intelligence . is not conclusive on this point but points strongly to some type of involvement. iv) This plant may be tooling up for the manufacture of FW 190 components since it is reported that Dornier is to undertake production of this aircraft and Friedrichshafen has been specifically mentioned. </Aircraft_and_Aero-Engines><Engineering_and_Armaments> Maybach Motorenbau G.m.b.H' Friedrichshafen (1) While the Maybach plant has been variously reported producing ball bearings, aero- engines, gears, gear boxes, and a multiplicity of other articles, its primary importance lies in the tank- engine field. Virtually all German tank engines are Maybach designed and available evidence renders it probable that upward of 60 per cent, of all German tank engines pass through the Friedrichshafen works. The plant also produces about one third of Germany's engines for semi-tracked vehicles. Engine repair facilities of considerable size and importance are also contained within the Friedrichshafen plant. Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen A.G. Friedrichshafen (1) Ground reports and other sources of intelligence Justify classifying the Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen as Germany's leading gear and gear-box makers.

South of the main station the lines again diverge, one important branch leading Southeast to Leipzig and a second West to Eisleben. A small local branch line also leads from the main station across the town and the river Saale and Westwards via Hettstedt to Eisleben. Marshalling Yards Halle (2) The goods station and the extensive marshalling yards are adjacent to and North of the main station. The traffic is important not only because of the mazy brown-coal mines surrounding Halle but also because of the town s proximity to the large Leuna works at Merseburg and the Buna plant- at Schkopau. In 1938 these yards had a capacity of 4,800 wagons per 24 hours. Railway Repair Shops Halle (2) These are important railway repair shops and are ^outh of and close to the main station.

This development is due not only to the vast extensions and the modernisations of its Free Port, but also to the exceptional facilities offered for storing and manipulating goods.in bond - notably colonial produce and oil. Hamburg's sea-going merchant fleet counted, on January 1st 1937, 1,536 ships, with an aggre- gate of 2,275,000 G.R.T. During 1936, the port's incoming and out- going traffic each amounted to 20-g- million tons net, while imports of goods reached 18 million tons, and exports 7i million tons. The old port was confined to the northern side of the River Elbe, but the really important and modern port has developed entirely along the river's southern bank,. This main port area falls roughly into two sections (a) centred on the HANSA-HAFEN and (b) on the ODER-HAFE N. . which pro- vide accommodation for the chief overseas liners. In the new port too are the big shipbuilding yards, And numerous engineering and armament works. Besides plants connected with shipbuilding, the port area accommodates other big engineering works and roughly half of Hamburg's veiFy important oil-storage installations (total pre-war capacity over 1,300,000 tons), oil-crushing mills, non- ferrous metal works, several aircraft and aircraft component factories including important airscrew works, as,well as grain, and other foodstuff factories and storage centres. N.xt in importance to the port proper comes the Harburg-Wilhelmsburg district, to the South, where big vegetable-oil plants, other food- processing factories, the huge grain and produce warehouses, chemical works and-a well-known rubber- tyre factory are located. Altona, on the northern bank of the Elbe, specialises more in light metal industries, including castings for aero-engines, but has also several other important industries and food- storage installations. In the i-nner port (Binnenhafen-Sandtorhafen), also on the Altona side.of the port, lies the very congested chief warehouse area. Khet of railway tracks connects this area with the Main Station of Hamburg. ‘ <pb n="304" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454444"/> One of the striking features of the central residential and commercial area of the city proper is the Alster Lake (actually a widened arm of the River gibe). The major (northern) portion of this lake is known äs the Aussen-Alster (outer Alster), and the much smaller and narrower southern tip is called the Binnen-Alster (inner Alster). Crossing this portion is thö Lombard bridge, which forms (or formed) the sole connecting link between the business district of the city and the large residential district to the West. The whole of the Binnen-Alster is now camouflaged. Apart from the industries and warehouses located in the port area, Altona, and Harburg- Wilhelmsburg, there are numerous works, storage installations, etc. scattered about other districts of greater Hamburg. The railway systemincludes nine major com- plexes of goods stations, marshalling yards, and sidings. Of these, five are situated in, or adjacent to, tjje port area. A sixth lies to the South of the Sudjer-Elbe (outside the port proper) stretching for about 7 km., roughly North to South, along the southern outskirts of Harburg, between the Gutmoor and the Wilstorf-Ronneburg district. The remaining three goods yards etc. are in the Altona, Stellingen, and Barmbeck areas. All are connected with the Hamburg Central Station. At the end of 1936 the railway-net measured 136 km., the tramway system 232 km. </Description><Transportation> Goods and Marshalling Yards Harburg-Wilhelmsburg (3) The capacity of this yard is U,800 waggons per 2U hours.

Its smelting and blast furnaces treat imported ores, matte, and concentrates, as well as imported scrap. The refineries ₜ treat blister copper and imported high- grade scrap. In 1938, the plant had an estimated capacity for electrolytic refining of 90,000 tons per annum and a capacity for fire refining of 30,000 tons per annum. Before the war, an appreciable quantity of nickel was recovered from fire-refined and electrolytic copper produced by other German refineries and, by means of the process of recovery employed at Norddeutsche Affinerie, some 350'tons of metallic nickel were produced annually before 1938 from these sources. ^his refinery was also engaged in recovering metal from the increased nickel coinage minted in 1933 "dien the coinage whs recalled in 1939' Since there is no great reservoir of nickel scrap to be drawn upon in Germany, it is probable that present production of recovered nickel amounts to only 50^ of capacity, which is estimated at ^00 tons of metal per annum. Some nickel may also be produced direct from Petsamo ores, in a small smelter which formerly treated Moroccan nickel-cobalt ores. These works also include a lead refining plant which had an annual capacity of 36,000 tons .before the war. Other installations are a small cobalt refinery and sulphuric acid plant.

(1) The works of this world-famous concern are in the centre of the town and are housed in a group of buildings several storeys high including one skyscraper building of 17 storeys. Several thousand workers are employed. The great majority of the work requires a high degree of specialised skill and there is an elaborate system of training schools for apprentices It is believed that no foreign labour is employed in Jena and because of the nature of the work, there is a probably unique concentration of highly skilled labour in this town. Zeiss have now three and possibly four large associated factories in Dresden, (Zeiss Ikon Werke A. G.) and branch factories are known to have been established in Hirschberg and Goriits in Silesia Zeiss controlled affiliated companies are at Stuttgart, Berlin, Rathenow and Vienna. Jena remains, however, the chief training centre for the concern and is by far the largest of the Zeiss works. It turns out the whole range of precision optical instruments required by the armed forces. These instruments are made in their entirety by the Zeiss works, of which one section is devoted to the casting, grinding and polishing of the lenses, while another section deals with the Complete manufacture of the precision metal parts of the instruments. The apprentice schools mentioned above, train workers for each of these two sections of the industry. It is worth noting that the Zeiss works at Jena are not an ordinary commercial conoern/ but since 1891 have been in the hands of a trust. The profits belong to the workers on a co- partnership basis and to the Jena University. It is believed that the Jena Works of Zeiss alone eqploy some 12,000. workers.

Situated on the main line from Western Germany to Italy via Switzerland, Karlsruhe is today of considerable importance as a transport centre. It is on this route that the bulk of coal supplies from the Ruhr to Italy is transported. Karlsruhe is also of some importance for waterway s traffic as its fairly modem harbour, connected with the Rhine by the Stich Canal, has extensive installations for reloading coal. Industrially Karlsruhe is not of great importance. Its main industry is engineering connected with armaments and it is situated mainly in the Eastern and Western outskirts of the town. There are two main target areas:- 'A” The inland port connected with the Rhine by the Stich Canal and the industrial area G-runwinkel, between which the town's power station is situated. (An important sector of the railway passes through this industrial area), B. To the East of the main railway station, the marshalling yard, large railway workshops and the town gas works.

This bay, about U miles:long and a quarter to 4 | miles: broad, is considered one of thebest havens in Europe. On its Western side is the mouth of thefamous Kaiser Wilhelm (or Kiel)Canal, and on the Eastern side, themouth of the river Schwentiene. Kiel is the principal base of the German Navy and in all respectsentirely a naval town, with dockyards, victualling and fuel stores,shipbuilding, engineering and armaments works. The harbour providesanchorage for a large fleet and quick access to the North Sea throughthe Kiel Canal, which Joins the river Elbe at Brunsbuttelkog. Thanks to the canal, Kiel is also safely connected by water withHamburg, Emden and the Dutch ports. The Canal's total length from Kiel(Holtenau)to Brunsbuttelkog on the Elbe is 53 nautical miles: and itsdepth 37,07 feet. The double lock gates of the Canal are at its Eastern (Holtenau)end and so are the two Easternmost bridges over the Canal, the Levensau^bridge and the Prinz Heinrich bridge. Both bridges carry roads, and thelocal railway line between Kiel and Flensburg passes over the Levensaubridge. There are two principal target areas in Kiel:- a)Stretching from Gaarden to Monckeberg along the Eastern sideof the Kieler Hafen. In this area are the three great shipbuilding yards,the big underground oil-storage plant and ammunition stores, and, in thecentre of the area, the largest Naval arsenal in Germany. Of outstandingimportance is the construction of U-bpats in this area. b)Immediately at and partly to the West of the Mouth of the KielCanal, in the Holtenau-Wick district is a group of less important targets.These targets consist of the Canal lock gates and bridges, the powerstation, oil-storage depots, and some Naval equipment works. A third series of outlying targets includes a plant producing thinshell and air leads, as well as assembling torpedoes, and other plantsmanufacturing torpedo components, aeronautical instruments, signallingapparatus, and light-metal products. Fifteen miles: Northwest of Kiel at Eckenförde there is believed tobe a new and important torpedo factory. </Description><Transportation> Lock gates of Kiel Canal Holtenau (3) These lock gates at the entrance of the Canal, in the Holtenau area, are 1,082 feet long, 147 feet wide and 49,9 feet high.

Although it possesses important industrial establishments, its chief significance lies in its situation at the crossing of a number of trade routes. It is the main railway-centre in the Rhineland, and a vezy important inland port. The geographical position of Cologne has been the chief factor in determining the nature of its industry. Its proximity to the Ruhr coalfields and its rail, road, and river transport facilities have caused the growth of firms specialis- ing in light and heavy engineering, chemicals, building, and textiles; in. peace-time Cologne was also noted for its luxuiy products, including chocolate and perfumery. Since 1939 there has been an expansion of certain engineer- ing works and other factories engaged on war production. These are concentrated mainly in Ehrenfeld, Kalk, and Mülheim to the East of the city on. the right bank of the Rhine. Other industrial districts with a fair number of important war factories are Sülz, Bayenthal, Poll, Deutz, Nippes, Riehl, and Niehl. Further important industrial concerns are to be found in the outlying districts of Heumar, Porz, Rondorf, Hürth, Kalscheuren, Knapsack-Goldenberg, Berrenrath, and Brauweiler. The built-up area of Cologne itself is of no importance from a purely industrial point of view, as it is composed mainly of residential areas with the appropriate shops, offices, and wholesale houses.

Apart from the explosives factory mentioned below there is no industrial development but the pre-war population will now have been largely increased presumably by the erection of workers' camps. </Description><Chemicals_and_Explosives> Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H. Kruppamüble (2) This factory is operated by the Lignose Sprengstoff G.m.b.H., but, owing to its inaccessible situation in Upper Silesia, there is very little up-to-date info mat ion regarding its activities. <pb n="420" url="https://visualcollections.ub.uni-mainz.de/histbuch/content/pageview/454561"/> The factory covers a large area and is believed to be well equipped; but, owing to its bad strategic situation in close proximity to the former Polish frontier, it does not appear to have been much used for military purposes until soma time after the invasion of Poland. Ground reports since that date suggest that the factory has now become of great importance, and although there is no air reconnaissance to confirm this, the reports must be considered of substance in view of the strategic situation of the plant, which is now as favourable as it was at one time dangerous. It has been reported that the factory manufactures hexanitrodiphenylamine, tetryl and T. N. T., and that it has its own nitric-acid plant. It has also been reported that the factory makes nitro- glycerine and nitrocellulose. It is not common practice to manufacture high explosives and propellant explosives in the same plant, but since the Kruppamühle factory was used for many years for the production of mining ejqolosives, it probably has a nitroglycerine plant, and for this reason a propellants section may have been developed.</Chemicals_and_Explosives></city><city name="KÜSTRIN"><state>Brandenburg</state><coordinates>52.35,14.40</coordinates><distance> 630 miles</distance><population> 22.000</population><Description> Kdstrin is situated 20 miles: North of Frankfurt a. d.
