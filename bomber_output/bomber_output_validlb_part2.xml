		<Description>  Leipzig is the largest town in Saxony. It is highly industrialised,particularly in textiles and. engineering. Prior to the war thefamous Leipzig Trade Fair draw a large conmercial public from allparts of the world. Leipzig s main railway station is the largestin Europe. The Supreme Courts of Law of the Reich are established inthe city and Leipzig is also the centre of the German publishingindustry. Railway lines radiate from the city in all directions, andthere are extensive marshalling yards which form an inportant base forthe traffic to the Eastern Front. Leipzig's industries have been devel-oped chiefly on the outskirts of the town ani can be divided into twomain groups. The first extends from the main station to the North Eastand South of the city. This area contains several importantengineering plants, spinning and weaving mills, and the Northern powerstation. The second industrial group is on the Western outskirts.This district includes some of the largest wool and cotton spinningmills in Europe and a number of big engineering works. During the warimportant aircraft assembly plants have been established on theairfield at Mochau on the North-eastern edge of the town area. Thecity also contains a number of chemical works, mostly engaged on themanufacture of soap and dyestuffs. </Description>
		<Transportation>Railway Centre     Leipzig   (2)   This terminal station, which is the largest   building of its kind in Europe, is an important   centre serving many parts of Germany and the   Continent. In particular there are lines leading   from Leipzig to Berlin, Breslau, Dresden Frankfort,   Halle, and Southern Germany. The area includes   marshalling yards, postal sidings and storage   depotsMarshalling Yards/LEIPZIG (contd.) Marshalling Yards     Paunsdorf  (3)   These marshalling yards, which are situated in   the Eastern suburb of Paunsdorf, can handle up   to 3500 wagons per 24 hours. Marshalling Yards     Wahren  (3)   These yards are in the North-western suburb   of Wahren. They have a capacity of 4500   wagons per 24 hours. Railway Repair Shops      Delitzsch (3)   At Delitzsch, 10 miles North of Leipzig, there   are railway workshops formerly employing scan&#169;   1,200 workers and undertaking chiefly the repair   of goods wagons. Power Station       Bohlex.   fl)   This very large thermal power station is owned   by the A.G. S&#228;chsische Werke (aSW)and has an   installed capacity of 393 MW. It is situated   on the brown-coal deposits at B&#246;hlen, 11 miles   S. of Leipzig, and is part of a large industrial   complex which includes, besides the power station,   a synthetic-oil plant (described below under   Liquid Fuels), a low temperature carbonisation   plant, (described below under </Transportation>

		<SolidFuels>), and   a gas-works (described below). The station is   operated on base load and supplies current to the   grid system and the city of Leipzig and is also   the source of power to the synthetic-oil plant,   whose estimated maximum demand is 75 MW with an   annual consumption of over 500 million kWh.   Five long-distance double-circuit 110 kV lines run   to Chemnitz, Gossnitz, Zeitz, Lausen, and Leipzig   respectively and another probably connects with   the neighbouring double station of E: penhain-   Molbis. Local 30 kV supplies connect to Leipzig   by underground cables and at lower voltages to   neighbouring industrial works. Gasworks        Bohlen  (3)   The gas works is part of the ASW complex at   BShlen and was erected in 1939 by the Company   for the supply of domestic gas to Leipzig and   the surrounding district. It operates the   Luigi complete-gasification process, using   brown coal. Capacity is belived to be about   5,000 million cu.ft. per annum.Power Statior/LEIPZIG (contd. ) Power Station      E: penhain-M&#246;lbis (1)   This large power station belongs to the ASW and   has an installed capacity of 297 M'. It is   situated between the villages of E: penhain and   M&#246;lbis, on the brown-coal fields about 5 miles   East of the B&#246;hlen station, and forms part of an   industrial complex which includes a low-temperature   carbonisation plant and a large new works as yet   unidentified. It is a double station with   duplicate generating plants 250'yards apart   arranged opposite and parallel to each other.   There is one switching and transformer station   common to both sections, and it is assumed   that a large part of the electrical output is   supplied to the nearby industrial plant, to   which steamis also supplied. The station   was under construction at the beginning of the   war and details are therefore incomplete.   There are at least 4 long-distance overhead   transmission lines, 2 running South-east   (possibly one to Dresden and one to Chemnitz),   one North-east (possibly to Leipzig), and one   West (possibly to B&#246;hlen). Power Station      Kulkwitz   (2)   This thermal power station is owned by the   Landkraftwerke Leipzig A.G. Kulkwitz, and is   situated on the brown coal fields 6 miles   South-west of Leipzig. It is an old station,   and up to 1938 was only of local importance,   with an installed capacity of 30 W. Since that   year it has been considerably extended and its   capacity increased to 105 MW. It is probable   that the station now gives additional supplies   to nearby industrial works and to the city of   Leipzig, and also to the high-voltage grid of   the A.G. S&#228;chsische Werke. St&#196;dt, Gaswerke     Leipzig   (2)   The municipal gasworks is the principal   distributing station on the Thuringian gas   grid. It now obtains all its supplies from   the B&#246;hlen gasworks (see above).

		<Description> Leverkusen is on the right bank of the Rhine 5 milesNorth of K&#246;ln. The industry is almost entirely concernedwith the large chemical works described below, which areimmediately to the South of Leverkusen and occupy an areaalmost as large as the town itself. </Description>
		<PublicUtilityServices> Electric Power Station   Leverkusen (2)  The thermal power station forms part  of the chemical works of the I.G. Farben  and has an installed capacity of 100 MW.  The station supplies both electricity  and steam to the works, which utilise  the whole of the plant's production. It  is not known whether the station is  connected to the grid. </PublicUtilityServices>
		<ChemicalsandExplosives>  I.G.Falbenindustrie A.G.    Leverkusen (1+)  The Leverkusen Works of the I.G. concern  ^ere formerly known as Friedrich Bayer  &amp; Co. and are still frequently referred .  to as the Bayer Works. The plant, which  is responsible for a high proportion of  the total German production of a number  of important chemical products, is of  very considerable importance in the German  chemical industry./OneLEVERKUSEN (contd.) I. G. Farbenindustrie A.G. (contd.)  One of its main activities is connected  with the tableting and ampouling of  pharmaceutical and medicinal preparations,  serums and associated products. It is  by far the largest tableting and ampouling  works in Europe, and, apart from finishing  medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations  manufactured at the Leverkusen works, also  undertakes the tableting and ampouling of  practically the entire output of these  products manufactured at Elberfeld, the  largest German pharmaceutical plant, and  H&#246;chst.  The heavy-chemical plant at Leverkusen  consists primarily of the sulphuric-acid  unit, which is estimated to have a capacity  of   tons per year or roughly 11$ of  the total German capacity. It is the largest  German sulphuric-acid unit. The plant is  also an important producer of electrolytic  caustic soda and chlorine'  Leverkusen is also one of the largest  German factories making dyes and associated  products. Anong other preparations made  here on a large scale are film base, films,  photographic paper, filters and photographic  chemicals. The works includes a synthetic-  rubber plant producing &#8221;Perdurine&#8221; rubber,  estimated to have a capacity of 4,000 tons  per annum. Several, apparently reliable,  reports indicate that toxic acids and smoke-  producing compounds are prepared at Lever-  kusen. It is probable that the filling process  would be carried out in one of the several  filling stations Situated within the Cologne  area. Situated within the works is the plant  of the Titanium G.m.b.H., one of the leading  German producers of titanium pignents.  It is believed that the Leverkusen works  employs more than 20,000 people. The works,  which extend for over one mile along the  river front,occupies the whole area between  the river and the North-to-South railway  along the right bank of the Rhine, which  here runs parallel with, and approximately  1,100 yards from, the river. The works has  extensive rail sidings, rail storage depots,  and large harbour facilities.Dynamit A.G./LSVERKUSEN (contd.) Dynamit A.G.     Schlebusch (2)  This factoiy was of considerable importance  in the last war. In 1918 it was one of the  most important T. N. T. factories in Germany  and produced more than 1,000 tons per month.  It was one of the few factories permitted  to continue the manufacture of T. N. T.  under the Versailles Treaty and was produc-  ing 294 tons monthly in 1923.  Both ground reports and air photographs  suggest that the factoiy has returned at  least to its full former level of activity,  and certain extensions appear to have been  made. The factory has not only its own  nitric-acid plant (as is common practice  in large explosives factories), but also its  own sulphuric-acid plant using the contact  process, which is unusual. It is apparent  that T. N. T. is still the chi&#169; product of  the plant, capacity being probably about  15,000 tons per annum. It is clear that  other explosives are also made at Schlebusch  but it is not certain what these are. It  almost certainly has plant for the manufacture  of nitroglycerine, which may now be used for  the production of diglycoldinitrate. In the  last war the factoiy produced a small quantity  of hexanitrodiphenyl-sulphide, and although  this explosive does not now appear to be used  by the German forces the plant would be suit-  able for the manufacture of hexanitrodiphenylamine.</ChemicalsandExplosives>

		<ChemicalsandExplosives> Dynamit A. G.       Lunow (3)   This factory was apparently under construction at   the beginning of the war and has certainly been   greatly enlarged since. There is very little   ground information concerning its activities, but   it appears to be important. Unfortunately the   only air reconnaissance of the region has provided   no more than a photograph of a small corner of the   explosives factory in which are some storage sheds.   The size of these does not contradict the impression   that the factory itself is not of considerable size.   It is fairly definitely established that penthrite is   made in this factory, and it was reported in 1940 that   plant for the production of a new explosive for         torpedoes/LUNCM (oontd.)   torpedoes and bombs had gone into   production. The nature of this   new explosive is uncertain, but   it may be hexanitrodipheuylamine   (which is commonly used in German   torpedoes and mines), or it may   be hexogen. It is significant   that the site of manufacture of   hexogen in Germany has not been   positively identified, although   this explosive is now used by   the German forces.   The factory is reported to be   opened by Dynamit A. G , but   its ownership has not been   confirmed.

		<Description>  Magdeburg is the largest town in the Prussian Province of Saxony,and contains heavy and general engineering works of the first order,aero-engine works, an explosives factory, and a large synthetic-oilplant. Its position on the River Elbe and on one of the main Northto South trade routes of Europe has given it from the earliest timesa commercial and industrial importance which it has maintained up tothe present day. It is one of the principal traffic centres of CentralGermany, and has a railway junction which is second only to Berlinitself with lines radiating N. to Hamburg and Rostock, E. to Berlinand the Baltic ports, S.E. to Leipzig and Czechoslovakia, S. toHalle, N&#252;rnberg and Munich, and W. to Hanover and the Ruhr. Thecentral German Leipzig-Magdeburg lines have been electrified. Themain part of the town is on the left bank of the Elbe, and is aclosely built-up area. Industries and groups of industries aresituated round most of the town's perimeter. One important groupis at N.ustadt and Rothensee, on the northern outskirts, but theGrusonwerk of Krupps, which occupies the first place in Magdeburg'sindustries, is in Buckau, the southern portion of the town.  There are large marshalling and goods yards both in Rothensee andin Buckau. The Western quarter of the town, which is known as theWilhelmstadt, and the Eastern suburb of Friedrichstadt, which is onthe right bank of the Elbe, contain groups of industries. The Elbedivides into two channels, forming an island which lies betweenMagdeburg and Friedrichstadt. This island is itself intersected bya third .narrow river channel (the Zoll Elbe)and contains an inlandharbour, with warehouses and storage depots.  The Mittelland Canal follows an E. -W. course 6 miles N. of thetown, but this important waterways route is broken where it shouldbe carried over the Elbe, due to the failure to complete theaqueduct, and also by the double ship lift at Hohenwarthe mile tothe east of the aqueduct. Barges therefore have to negotiate the40-60 ft. change in level to the river by the Rothensee shiplift,pass down the N. -S, branch canal into the Elbe, and rejoin theIhle section of the canal by the locks at Niegripp, a distance ofsome 8 miles by water from the Rothensee shiplift.  The town of Sch&#246;nebeck, 9 miles to the South of Magdeburg,where there are aircraft, ammunition, and chemical factories, isdealt with separately.  </Description>
		<Transportation>Inland HarbourMagdeburg(2)  Magdeburg has extensive inland harbour facilities  for the Elbe traffic. The Handelshafen and the  Industriehafen, the two largest docks, are at the  Northern end of the town close to the industrial areas  of N.ustadt and Rothensee. There are several smaller  docks and loading basins further downstream at Rothensee  and connected with the Weser-Elbe Canal by the N. -S.  branch canal and the Rothensee shiplift. This is part of  the Mittelland Kanal system, which is continued Eastward  from the Elbe to link up with the Oder. There is a further  large dock known as the Zollhafen on the island formed by  the two arms of the Elbe between Magdeburg and the suburb  of Friedrichstadt. Magdeburg hamiles up to 2 million tons  of waterborne goods per annum, including grain, sugar beet,  vegetables, coal and timber.The/MAGDEBURG contd.;  The shiplift is situated at the top of the N. -S.  branch canal dose to its junction with the Mittolland  canal; it can lift or lower barges up to 1,000 tons to  the maximum of 60 ft. required by the level of the Elbe.  Railway Junction    Magdeburg   (J)  The main line from Hamburg to Halle and Saxony  passes through Magdeburg from North to South.  One of the principal routes from Berlin to the  Lower Rhineland crosses the Elbe at Rothensee  and continues westwards from Magdeburg to Brunswick.  Five other important branch lines radiate from  Magdeburg. The railway junctions are in the  Rothensee area and to the South of the main railway  station.  Marshalling Yard and Repair shops Buckau     (2)  The Buckau marshalling yard is the most important in  Magdeburg, and has capacity for handling 3,800 wagons  per 24 hours. It extends for 2 miles to the S. of  the town. There is a large loco, depot and loco repair  shops which are possibly only partly active.  Marshalling Yards     Rothensee   (3)  These extensive marshalling yards are close to  the Industriehafen and to the junction of the lines  from Berlin and Hamburg. They have a capacity for  3,000 wagons per 24 hours.  Goods Station     Magdeburg   (3)  The main goods station, which includes a number  of large storage depots, is immediately South of  the main railway station in the centre of the town.  Railway Repair Shops    Salbke    (3)  These large and well-equipped repair shops are  believed to employ some 2500 workers, and undertake  repairs and maintenance of all kinds of railway  rolling stock. They are in the South Eastern suburb  of Salbke, and close to the works of the R. Wolf A. G. </Transportation>
		<PublicUtilityServices>  Power Station'Mikramag'    Rothensee   (1)  This thermal power station is situated N. of the  Industriehafen on the N. -S. branch canal of the  Mittelland Canal. Its installed capacity is at least  130 MW and it is designed for expansion to at least  200 MW. The station supplies steam and electricity to  the adjacent synthetic-oil plant referred to below under  Liquid Fuels the estimated requirements of which are  100 MW, and to the nearby electrolytic zinc works (estimated  requirements 35 MW and 25 tons/hr steam), referred to below  under Non-ferrous Metals. Electricity is also supplied to  the city of Leipzig. One 110 kV long-distance transmission  line connects to the sub-station at Buckau S. of the town,  and via that sub-station to the sub-station at Diesdorf,  referred to below.Sub-statioi^/MAGDEBURG- (conto. )  S&#252;b-station      Diesdorf  (3)  This sub-station is situated 2 miles W. of Magdeburg  and is probably owned by jreussenelektra. It is  on the 220-kV line linking the Ruhr-Westphalian area  with Berlin and is the junction point for several lines  connecting to the brown-coal-field stations in the  Leipzig area.  110 kV lines connect to F&#246;rderstadt, Golpa, Mikramag  via Buckau, and Brandenburg.  Gasworks        Rothensee   (2)  The Grossgaserei Mitteldeutschland A.G. , which  belongs to the Deutsche Continental-Gas&#8212;gesellschaft,  owns a large gasworks at Rothensee which supplies the  local long-distance gas system, including the town of  Magdeburg and Aschersleben, K&#246;then and Halberstadt.

		<Description>  The twin towns of Mannheim and Ludwigshafen form an industrialcentre of great importance, which lies on either side of the Shineat the confluence of the Shine and N.ckar. Mannheim, which is itselfdivided by the river N.ckar, lies on the Eastern and Ludwigshafen onthe Western bank of the Shine. The main railway line up the Shinevalley to Basle passes through Mannheim which is a Junction for abranch leading through Heidelberg and the N.ckar valley to Heilbronnand Stuttgart. To the West a railway crosses the Rhine to Ludwigs-hafen, Kaiserslautern and the Saar. The harbour area is chieflyconcentrated on the right bank of the Rhine immediately North ofMannheim. There are three main industrial areas. The first lies tothe North of Ludwigshafen and is entirely covered by the huge chemicalworks of the I.G Farbenindustrie concern. These works form thelargest industrial chemical complex in Germany. Opposite these worksand on the right bank of the Alt-Rhine are many engineering concerns,including Daimler Benz and Brown Boveri. To the South of the City endin the suburbs of N.ckarau and Rheinau are chemical and engineeringplants, marshalling yards and an airport. Frankenthal, which issituated some five miles North West of Ludwigshafen, is dealt withseparately. and Description of Target    Location PriorityRating Inland Port      Mannheim   (1)   The Mannheim port area is divided into two   sections which lie on either side of the N.ckar   in the Northern quarter of Mannheim, The Mfthlau-   Hafen is between the Rhine and the left bank of the   N.ckar and contains numerous warehouses, loading quays   and rail sidings. The Industriehafen on the opposite   side of the N.ckar contains, beside the usual quay aid   loading facilities, many small industrial undertakings^   including engineering concerns, oil storage plants,   and grain silos. This port is the main transhipment   centre on the Upper Rhine. Inland Port      Ludwigshafen (2)   The inland port of Ludwigshafen on the left bqnk   of the Rhine extends from the Southern extremity of   the I.G. Farbenindustrie Works to the Northern end of   the Raschig chemical plant, a total distance of three   miles. This is an important transhipment centre for   coal and hamiles a large proportion of the products   of the numerous chemical factories in the twin-towns.   The area includes warehouses, oil storage plants,   and grain silos, and is extensively served by rail   sidings.Inland Port/MANNHEIM (oontd,)  Inland.

It is situated on the east bank   of the river Rhine in the southern suburbs of Mannheim   and is only 2 miles West of the two important sub-   stations at Rheinau and three miles East of the sub-   station at Mundenheim, being connected to both by high   tension transmission lines It is believed that it is   also connected, either directly or via Mundenheim, to   the nearby I.G. Farben works at Ludwigshafen-Oppai   The station has 11 turbo-generating sets, one of which   is housed underground Cooling water is taken from   the river Rhine Underground 20 kV. lines connect the   station with the old Mannheim power station which now   serves as a sub-station, with the two other old stations   in the city with the old Rheinau station and with the   Badenwerke sub-station In addition there is a double   circuit 110 W line to Mundenheim sub-station of the   Pfalzwerke and to the Rheinau sub-station of the   BadenwerkeKraftwerk Ludwigshafen-Oppat/MANNHEIM (contd.)   Kraftwerk Ludwigshafen-Oppau  Ludwigshafen (1)  Owned by the I.G. Farbeniniustrie,. this thermal  power station is situated between Ludwigshafen and  Oppau in the N. W. suburbs of Mannheim within the  site of the I.G. chemical works. Also within the  site but to the East of it on the west bank of the  river Rhine is a new station, which in 1943, was  still under construction. The total installed  capacity is estimated at 200 MW'. The old station  had 6 turbo-generators and the new station is  believed to have one generator with a total of 75  MW. generating capacity. The source of water for  cooling is the river Rhine, the new station however,  though situated close to the river, has two cooling  towers. Power is supplied to the associated works,  and the stations are believed to be connected with  the Mannheim generating station either directly or  via the Mundenheim sub-station. Half a mile N. W.  of the chemical works an outdoor sub-stat ion,  apparently designed for 3 transformers each of 40 W.  capacity, is under construction. It will be connected  to three high voltage lines, with the object probably  of providing a means of incorporating the greater  part of the electricity requirements of the works in  the event of damage to the local generating plant.

It is op the riverNogat, which is a tributary of the Vistula, and navigable for smallcraft. In peacetime there were no industries of great importance,and the town was mainly an agricultural centre. Since the war,however, a Focke-Wulf aircraft works has been erected near the town.These works are mentioned below. </Description>
		<AircraftandAero-Engines>  Focke-Wulf     K&#246;nigsdorf   (1)  These highly important aircraft works were erected  probably in 1941-42 as a result of the decision  by Focke-Wulf to transfer aircraft assembly from  Bremen to what then seemed to be less vulnerable  areas in the East. They were built as an assembly  plant fed by components from Cottbus, Posen and  Kresinki. The works are .solely engaged on the  assembly of the FA-190 single engine fighter. The  works are at the village of K&#246;nigsdorf, 4 miles East  of Marienburg; and one mile South of the Marienburg-  Elbing highway. Up to August 1943 the plant was  still in process of expansion, and more than 1,000  workers, including Ps/W were engaged on the excavations.</AircraftandAero-Engines>

The  installed capacity is 150 mW. which is probably  taken entirely by the rubber plant, whose demand  is estimated to be up to 125 MW. and whose annual  requirements are about 900 million kWh. Steam  as well as electricity are supplied to the  works.  At the pithead of the adjacent colliery (see under  " </PublicUtilityServices>
		<SolidFuels> ")is a small station containing about  10 MW. capacity of generating plant. A transformer  station is situated to the South-west of the main  station. A line, probably operated at 110 kv,  connects to the 135 MW. station at L&#252;nen, possibly  via Recklinghausen.   Auguste Viktoria      H&#252;ls   (3)  The coal mine of the Gewerkschaft Auguste Viktoria  at H&#252;ls has four pit heads, and in 1937 produced  1,200,000 tons of coal. There is a coking plant  (230 ovens)with an annual estimated dry-coal  capafity of 860,000 tons. Some 4,000 workers were  employed in 1937.  </SolidFuels>
		<RubberandTyres> Chemische Werke H&#252;ls G.m.b.H.   H&#252;ls   (1)  H&#220;ls lies near the village of Marl, about ten  miles East of E: sen. Before the war a coke-oven  plant founded by Ruhrchemie and Th. Goldschmidt,  produced ethylene, ethylene chlorhydrin, ethylene  glycol, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol ethers.  This plant was acquired by Chemische Werke H&#252;ls  G.m.b.H. owned jointly by I.G.Farbenindustrie and/Bergwerksgesellsohaft&#196;AKJU \UW1UU,  Chemische Werke Hftls G.m.b.H. (contd.)  Be rgwerksge seil sic haft Hibernia A. G. (which is  owned by the Prussian State). The original  capital in 1938 was RM. 30,000,000 of which  RM. 22,200,000 belonged to I.G. and 7,800,000  to Hibernia.  Construction of a synthetic rubber plant was  announced early in 1937 and completed in 1940. Unlike  the plant at Schkopau, Hdls was designed to make its  acetylene from hydrocarbon gases by the electric arc  process; otherwise the same four-stage process is used,  It is believed that when production first started gas  was used from the existing coke oven plant, but at a  later date a pipe line from the Gelsenkirchen oil plant  was completed and presumably the waste hydrocarbon  gases from this plant are now used, either alone or  in conjunction with the coke oven gas.  It is believed that the styrene and aciylic nitrile  also required for Buna production are made within the  works. Power comes principally from a plant within  the works of about 150 mW. capacity which is owned by  Steinkohlen Kiekt ria it &#196;ts A.G. E: sen, (Steag), a  subsidiary of the R.W.E. This plant has been leased to  Chemische Werke Httls for fifteen years. Steag has  also undertaken to supply any additional current  required fromits plant at I/Lnen on the Lippe, and  a power line with transformer station is already  installed.  Coal for the coke oven and power plant is brought  in by conveyor from Shaft III of the Auguste Viktoria  Colliery owned bjjr I.G., which is situated at the  eastern boundary of the works.  There is little doubt that the nominal capacity  of H&#252;ls is about 3Q,000 tons per annum and that output  was, at least approximately, restored to this figure  early in 1944 after' the successful attack of June 194-3</RubberandTyres>

The   Leunawerke is one of the largest industrial plants   in Germary and covers an area of about 1-J- sq. miles,   manufacturing ammonia, fertilisers, chemicals, synthetic   oil and other products. The production of synthetic   petrol was begun here on a large scale in the year   1932, and since that date, both before and during the   war, the works have been continually extended. The   Bergius hydrogenation process is used for the treatment   of brown coal and brown-coal tar. Reports indicate   that in 1943 an annual capacity of 600,000 tons of   liquid products had been reached. The Leuna Werke   output of methanol was estimated in 1943 to be covering   three-fourths of Germany's requirements. A wide   range of other synthetic hydrocarbons is also made at   Leuna. Some 50,000 workers are engaged at the Leuna   works, more than half of this total being women. There   are workers' colonies at Leuna and Merseburg, but a   large proportion of the labour travels daily from Halle. </LiquidFuelsandSubstitutes>

A numberof important industrial undertakings is grouped in the neighbourhoodof this town. The VAWAG have an aluminium works 6 miles to the Eastin the small village of Toging. The administrative headquarters ofthese works are in Muhldorf itself. The pre-war population as givenabove has probably been increased owing to the expansion of theseworks. There is an explosives works at Kraiburg, 6 miles to theSouth-west, and further upstream on the River Inn. The works,described below, is one of a number of chemical and explosives factoriesdispersed over this part of Bavaria. Others are dealt with under theheadings Alt&amp;tting, Burghausen, and Trostberg. Five miles to the South-east of Mnhldorf, at the village of Steiner am Hart, on a branch rail-way leading to Trostberg, there is a large calcium carbide and cynamideworks. The stretch of the River Inn between Wasserburg and Toging, adistance of 25 miles, is utilised for an important hydro-electricscheme. </Description>

		<Description>   Munich (Munchen)is the largest city in Bavaria and the fourth  largest in Germany. Prior to 1933 it was the seat of the Bavarian  Government. Munich is the birthplace of the Nazi Movement and has  become the headquarters of the Nazi Party.   The city is in the Bavarian highlands, and is 1,700 feet above  sea level. It lies to the North of the foothills of the Bavarian  Alps, and is on the River Isar. Munich is the centre of an  important network of railways and has direct connection with France  (through Strassburg), with Austria (through Rosenheim), and with  Italy (through Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass).   Munich was the residence of the Kings of Bavaria. It is a  university town, and a cultural centre of European importance.  Traditionally the city has long been celebrated for artistic handi-  crafts, including bronze founding, glass staining, silversmith's  work, and wood carving, in addition to the manufacture of astron-  omical and mathematical in st imments. During the present century  a big development of Munich&#179;s engineering industry has taken place,  and there are now several large works, which are of the highest  value to Germany's war production, making railway locomotives,  aircraft and other engines, chemicals, and rubber tyres. The  larger of these firms are mentioned below, including the E: M.W.  aero-engine works and the four plants now established in Munich by  the Dornier concern. In addition to these, there are reports of  further new aircraft and aero-engine factories having been opened  in the Munich area by Messerschmitt and Daimler-Benz,   Also included in the Munich area are the Oberwiesenfeld air-  field district North-west of Munich (where the E:M.W. and other  works are situated), the suburbs of Moosach to the North East,  Pasing to the West and H&#246;llriegelskreuth which lies about 5 miles  South of Munich. Wolfratshausen, 18 miles South of Munich, where  there is a large explosives factory and a reported new Dornier  plant, is described under its own heading.  </Description>
		<Transportation>   Railway Centre     Munich  (2)    Munich is a focal point in the German railway    system. The terminal railway station is    situated on the Western side of the city    centre. Direct trunk lines radiate to the North and    North-west Germany via N&#252;rnberg; to North-    eastern Germany and to Czechoslovakia; to    Vienna via Braunau and via Salzburg; to the    South via Rosenheim and also via Mittenwald    to Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass; South    westwards to Lindau, Friedrichshafen and    Switzerland; and to the West via Augsburg    to the Upper Rhine Valley and Strassburg.    Several minor branch lines lead Southward    from Munich and serve the Upper Bavarian    highlands. The main station is fully    electrified, as are all but one of the main    lines that radiate from Munich.MUNCHEN (contd. ) Marshalling Yards      Munich  (3)  The chief marshalling yards lie to the West  of the main railway station and had in 1938  a capacity for handling 3,000 wagons per 24  hours The yard is fully electrified Goods Yards       Munich  (3)  In addition to the large goods station  adjoining the main passenger station, there  are also goods yards with extensive storage  facilities adjacent to the three suburban  stations; M&#252;nchen-Nord, M&#252;nchen-Ost and  Mftnchen-S&#220;d Marshalling Yards      M&#252;nchen (Ost)(3)  These yards, which lie to the East of the  town, had a capacity for handling 2,000  wagons per 24 hours in 1938.

The  installed capacity is 85 MW but the final  capacity of the station is planned to be  100 MW. The station is believed to be  connected to ocher stations owned by the  Munich Cox'poration.  A substation is attached and connects the  power station with tue Ampen werke A.G. and  the Bayernwerke A.G. grids,MUNCHEN (contd.)  Hydro Sc deme      Middle Isar )            (1)  Hydro Scheme     Uppenborn )   These electric power systems utilise the    water power of the River Isar and consist    of two groups of hydro-electric power    stations situated to the North-east of    Munich. Two diversionary canals are used.    Seven miles North-east of Munich the Isar    is diverted into a large reservoir fron    which a aanal has been cut to rejoin the    river 18 miles to the North near Moosburg.    The four power stations of this (the    Middle Isar)group are at Finsing where    the canal leaves the reservoir at Aufkirchen,    at Eitting, and at Pfrombach.   The capacities of these stations are 11,    J6, 32, and 28 MW. respectively.   Between Munich and Moosburg the Isar has    a course of 32 miles and gives a 290    head to this group of stations. The annual    electrical output of the Middle Isar group    is nearly 500 million kWh and is supplied    in approximately equal parts to the State    Railways and the city of Munich.   From Moosburg to Landshut the canal is    continued close to the right bank along a    15-mile stretch of the river, giving a    head of 60. This second and smaller group    of power stations, known as the Uppenborn    group, includes the old Uppenborn station    of 8 MW., the new Uppenborn I of 28 MW.    and the new Uppenborn II of 18 MW.

It is on the main railwayline from Karlsruhe to Stuttgart, and is the Junction for twominor branch lines leading South into the Black Forest district. Pforzheimis the centre of the precious, semi-precious,and imitation Jewellery industry. It is also one of the chiefcentres for clock and watch making, which is a speciality ofthe Black Forest region of Baden. These industries wereformerly carried out largely in the homes of the individualworkers, and it may be said that almost every house in thiscity is a small workshop, but there are two factories builton a larger scale. Gold and silver refining is carried outin Pforzheimin connection with this Jewellery trade. A.S was the case during the 1914-1918 war, most of thefactories and workshops of Pforzheim will have now been timedover to the manufacture of precision parts for instrumenta,small-arms components, fuzes, clockwork movements, and similarproducts for which this specialist labour and plant are suited. </Description>

		<ChemicalsandExplosives> Stickstoffwerke    Piesteritz (1)   The large chemical works of the Mittel-   deutsche Stickstoffwerke A.G. were merged   into the Bayerische Stickstoffwerke A.G.   and are now associated with the Ammoniak-   Werke Merseburg G.m.b.H. a subsidiary of   the I. G. Farben concern. The Piesteritz works   are important producers of nitrogenous   fertilisers, notably nitro-phoska and   calcium cyanamide. Nitro-phoska is a combined   nitrogen-phosphorus-potash fertiliser. The   production of calcium cyanamide for the two   plants, Piesteritz and Trostberg in Bavaria,   is believed to be 125,000 tons per annum.   There is also a plant at Piesteritz for the   manufacture of concentrated nitric acid, of   which the production is 60 tons daily.   These works are also reported to be the  largest producers of phosphorus in Europe.  In 1932 it was reported that the annual  production was approximately 30,000 tons.  There are three 3~phase furnaces, each  consuming 12,000 kW. In normal times a  large part of this phosphorus was sent to  Wolfen for the manufacture of phosphoric  acid, itself used for makingsnitro-phoska.  Phosphorus is used for the manufacture of  incendiary bombs, tracer/incendiary Si A.A.,  . simple tracer S.A.A., and larger-calibre  tracer shells made with pyrotechnic  compositions. Fire-raising ansnunition is  almost entirely dependent on phosphorus.  It is also used in smoke-producing shells  for ranging purposes. These chemical works  are on the Northern bank of the Elbe on  the Western side of Piesteritz.        /RubberPIESTERITZ (contd.) </ChemicalsandExplosives>

Before   the war this firm produced bicycle and motor-   cycle tyres, footwear, and general lubber goods.   The plant is now believed to be making fuel-   tank covering, respirator face-pieces, and   protective clothing. The Piesteritz factory   includes a reclaim plant with a capacity of   2500 tons per annum. At the end of 1943   seme 2,000 workers were employed. It is   thought possible that the civilian footwear   production has now been transferred to the   Kleinwittenberg factory.

After the last war   it was converted to the manufacture of   artificial fibres and greatly enlarged. It   is believed that a great deal of nitro-   cellulose for other than explosive purposes   is still made and it seems almost certain   that the production of explosive nitrocellulose   has also been resumed to some extent. A   number of the explosives buildings were   retained. It is estimated that the total   capacity for the production of nitrocellulose   is approximately 15,000 tons per annum,   of which perhaps one half might be available   for explosives manufacture. The production   of finished propellant powders has been   reported here and it is possible that a powder   plant of moderate size exists.        /A PREMNITZ (contd.)   I. G.

		<Description>  Regensburg is on the South bank of the Danube 60 miles North ofMunich, and is an important railway junction and transhipment port.The Danube is navigable as far as Regensburg for barges up to 1,000 tonsand goods can therefore be carried from the Black Sea and the Balkansup to Regensburg without transhipment. This port is now of part inula rvalue in view of the large amount of Roumanian oil which is shipped toit up the Danube.  The pre-war industries of Regensburg also included shipbuilding,the manufacture of tiles, drainage pipes and stoneware, and severalsmall engineering works. There are a number of saw-mills, and theinland port handled a large amount of timber. The Regensburg worksof the Messerschmitt A.G., have been greatly developed during the war.  The VAWAG have a large alumina works at Schwandorf, 15 miles tothe North on the river Nab, which flows into the Danube 3 miles Westof Regensburg. These works are described under the heading ofSchwandorf. </Description>
		<Transportation> Inland Harbour      Regensburg (2)  The inland harbour is to the East of the town and   on the right bank of the Danube. It has been   greatly extended in recent years. In addition to   the two original docks, there is now a system of   four large docks further to the East opening out   of an entrance basin two miles upstream from the   town. This inland port is of great importance to   the traffic in oil from Roumania, a large proportion   of which is transhipped at Regensburg. Railway Junction     Regensburg (3)  Two important main railway lines, from Nurnberg   eastwards to Passau and Vienna, and from Hof   southwards to Munich, meet in Regensburg and, after   passing through the railway station, diverge again   to the East of the town.

Obertraubling (2)    The Messerschmitt concern of Augsburg built their   first big branch works in 1937 on a site occupying   a large area to the West of the town adjacent to the   former civil airport on the Southern bank of the   Danube inside the bejid which the river makes North   of the village of Pr&#252;fening. Production began in   1938 and the plant has concentrated ever since on   successive models of the Me. 109 single-engined   fighter. With the expansion programme instituted   in the German aircraft industry in 1942-43 output   increased considerably until the effective daylight   air attack of August 1943.    A second Messerschmitt plant has been established by    the conversion and extension of a former G.A.F.    station at Obertraubling, 4 miles to the South-east    of Regensburg. This works was engaged on the    assembly of the large Messerschmitt transport glider,    (the Me.321)and of the powered version of the same    aircraft (the 6-engined Me.323). The August attack    on Pr&#252;fening was so effective that Me. 109 assembly    was for the most paid; transferred to Obertraubling,    while Me. 321 and 323 assembly began at Leipheim    where assembly space had been acquired. Reconstruction    of the Pr&#252;fening works was vigorously undertaken and    production resumed. A series of raids in February    1944 inflicted such severe damage that the plant is    thought likely to be abandoned. Obertraubling was    bombed in the same February raids with equal effective-    ness and no attempts at assembly repair work had been         /madeREGENSBURG- (Bavaria)(Continued)   macle by early April. Some assembly hangars are,   however, still usable.   The Regensburg complex was up to August 1943   employing some 10,000 workers.  </AircraftandAero-Engines>

		<Description> Rostock is near the mouth of the River Warnow, which fromthis point flows through a wide channel to enter the Baltic 6 miles to the North at Warnemhnde. It is one of the larger GermanBaltic ports and a considerable trade with Denmark and Sweden isbandied in the harbour of Rostock itself and in Warnem&#252;nde, whichserves as an advanced port. The N.ptun shipbuilding concern is animportant builder of submarines, and these yards, together with theprincipal works of the Heinkel concern, make Rostock a productioncentre of the highest value at the present time. These twoundertakings form the main part of Rostock's industry. Their outputhas been considerably reduced by bombing attacks and by the transferof a large part of the Heinkel activities to Oranienburg.The/ROSTOCK VMfiCK4.enPUr.g7 \uonuu; The town is on the left bank of the Warnow. The central areais closely built and largely composed of buildings dating back tothe days of the Hanseatic League. This part of the town was heavilydamaged by bombing in 1942. The shipbuilding yards are on the Western outskirts of thetown, and three of the Heinkel plants are situated in the same Areaalong the railway from Rostock to Warnen&#252;nde, which follows theRiver Warnow approximately half a mile from the left bank. A fourthHeinkel plant, is at the Eastern end of the town near to the goodsstation and the gasworks. The other industries, which includechemical plants and a number of minor engineering works, are in theSouthern and Western quarters of the town area. Rostock is thelargest town in Mecklenburg and is the seat of a University. </Description>
		<Transportation> Port Area      Rostock   (3)   In peacetime Rostock's tirade is mainly   with Denmark and Sweden, and an important   railway link with Copenhagen is the   train ferry whicb runs from Warnem&#252;nde to   G jedsen in Denmark. The larger of the   two chief docks of the port is at Warnem&#252;nde   6 miles to the North of Rostock where the   River Warnow, after widening into a large   lagoon (Der Breitling), is connected with   the Baltic by a narrow channel through the   tongue of land on which Warnem&#252;nde is   built. Railway Junction    Rostock   (3)   The main line connecting Rostock with   Berlin and Hamburg passes through the   principal railway station on the   Southern outskirts of the town and runs   close to the left bank of the Wamow to   Warnem&#252;nde.

Marienehe was the research   and development centre and has been   responsible for the design of a long   series of Heinkel types (bombers,   seaplanes, transport types, etc.).   The main type produced is the He.Ill   twin-engined bomber which has been   in production in successive versions   since 1935' The He. 177 heavy bomber   has been built in small numbers since   1941 but large-scale assembly has been   transferred elsewhere (Oranienburg and   Arado, Brandenburg). Marienehe still   produces the twin - He.Ill five -   engined glider-towing aircraft.   The works are on a large scale with   five assembly halls and over 20 separate   machine shops. They have been   continually expanded during the past few   years. Large-scale production of   Heinkel types was also from 1937 under-   taken at the Oranienburg subsidiary   (He.Ill's)near Berlin and in 1942-43 at   the Schwechat plant near Vienna (He.219   twin-engined dive-bomber and recently   He.280 Jet-propelled fighter). A&#8347; a   result of the April 1942 raid on Rostock   the research sections, together with   their equipment and the wind tunnel, were   moved to Schwechat. Heinkel       Bleicherstr.   The Bleicherstrasse works, which are   in the South-eastern quarter of the city   of Rostock employ some 9 000 workers   and make aircraft metal components   mainly stamped and pressed parts,   including supports, frames and seats,   both for the Marienehe plant and for the   Heinkel assembly works in Oranienburg   (near Berlin)and Vienna. Heinkel       Werft str.   The Werftstrasse works, which are in   the Western quarter of the city between   the N.ptun shipbuilding yards and the   railway line, employ 2,000 workers   and construct fuselages and wing   components.

(2)   The N.ptunwerft Rostock Schiffswerft   und Maschinenfabrik G.m.b.H. is an   important shipyard, who at one time   built only merchant ships but since   193&#214; have been increasingly turned   over to warship construction. In   the present war they have completed   a number of 500-ton submarines, escort   vessels, and &#214;DO-ton mine sweepers.   In September 1943 the maximum figure   of 9 U-boats were under construction.   These yards can also build merchant   vessels up to 7500 tons and in 1943   comnenced work on orders for 3000-ton   merchant ships under the German "Hansa"   programs.   The four building slips vary between   250'and 600 ft. in length and two   floating docks of 310 and 400 ft.   length are also attached to the yard.   In 1941 some 2,000 workers were   reported to be employed, including a   high proportion of foreign labourers,   the majority of whom were French.   The N.ptunwerft was undertaking ship   repairs on a large scale, this side   of the yard's activities having been   greatly developed. They have important   machine shops and produce their own   marine steam engines, boilers and   superheaters.     &#8212;0O0&#8212;&#8212;</AircraftandAero-Engines>

The industrial targets in the area are concentrated in a narrowstrip of territory which extends East from the river Rhine and is about30 miles long and 10 miles wide; and which lies approximately betweenthe river Ruhr and the Rhe in-Herne canal. The Ruhr and the adjacentareas in Rhineland and Westphalia contain a concentration of industrywhich is without parallel in Europe. An almost unbroken chain of greatindustrial cities runs from Duisburg in the West through Oberhausen,M&#252;lheim, E: sen, Giesenkirchen, and Bochum to Dortmund in the East. Notwithstanding the policy of industrial dispersal and the heavyair attacks, there has been no appreciable movement of heavy industryaway from the Ruhr to safer areas and, although strenuous efforts havebeen made to develop new heavy industrial plants elsewhere, the Ruhrarea retains nearly all of its pre-war importance as the principalcentre of heavy industry in Germany.Division into districts For trie purpose of this report the Ruhr has been divided into 14districts, under which headings they should be sought in the text.These conform roughly with the district boundaries as marked on theG.S.&amp;S.

The heavy press capacity at R&#252;sselsheim   is partly devoted to the fabrication of   Ju.88 bomber components for supply to   the assembly plants at Bernburg and   elsewhere. These components incl trie   the frameworks for cockpit covers, for   transparent nose units and for gun   turret covers.

R&#252;sselsheim These works, occupying a larga site West and South West of R&#252;sselsheim, with a quay frontage on the South bank of the Main, at one time produced the Opel range of cars and lorries. They were owned by General Motors. Their pre-war output was up to 120,000 units annually, the works having a productive capacity at,the rate of 200,000 units per annum. In 1935, lorry production was transferred to a new plant at Brandenburg, many of the components continuing to be made at R&#252;sselsheim, however. At the outbreak of war car production was stopped and a portion of the plant was converted to the manufacture of air-frame components for Junkers 88 aircraft. Aircraft propellor reduction gearing for Daimler-Benz aircraft engines was also manufactured. In addition, large quantities of vehicle spare parts continued to be made, R&#252;sselsheim being responsible for maintaining the Opel service and repairs organisation, whilst parts were sent to the loriy producing plant at Brandenburg. It was reported early in 1943 that R&#252;sselsheim was to concentrate upon lorry production, and several reports concerning the manufacture of lorries at this plant have been received. On the other hand, several references to the manufacture of aircraft engines have been received in 1943 In addition, reference has been made to the manufacture of armoured cars, tracked motor cycles, and amphitfous vehicles. The number of workers has been variously reported and the whole R&#252;sselsheim complex would appear to employ 20,000 to 25,&#8304;&#8304;&#8304; workers including a large number of foreigners.(1)</EngineeringandArmaments>

		<PublicUtilityServices> Hydro Scheme      Saale   (2)   With the primary object of improving the   navigation of the river Elbe in dry   periods and of preventing flood damage,   two large dams have been erected at   Bleiloch and Hohenwarte to control the   inflow of the Saale, a tributary of the   Elbe. These dams and their reservoirs,   which impound a water volume almost equal   to the annual flow of the Saale, are   among the largest in Germany. The water   power thus created is used to serve an   important hydro scheme. The four   generating stations described below are   now fully developed, and it is probable   that plans exist for further constructions   which will greatly increase the output.  -N.ar Saalburg, 20 miles South-east of   Saalfeld, is the Bleilooh dam and   reservoir and its adjacent Burgkhanrner   compensating reservoir. The generating   stations of these two have capacities of   40 UW and 5 respectively. A pump-   storage station operates between the two   reservoirs. Pour miles South-east of   Saalfeld, near the village of Kaulsdorf,   is the Hohenwarte dam and reservoir and   its adjacent Eichicht compensating   reservoir. The generating stations of   these two have capacities of 50'and 5   W respectively. A pump-storage station   operates between the two reservoir's.        It/SAAIFELD (Thuringia)(Contd) It la planned to construct a further pump-storage station of 368 MW capacity using the Eichicht compensating reservoir as a lower reservoir and a high level reservoir in the hills on the left bank of the River Saale. An indoor substation, owned by the Thhringenwerke A.G., Weimar, is situated 270 feet above the Bleiloch generating station, and contains two 10/50/100 kV transformers of 20 W. capacity. 100 kV lines go to Herlasgrtm and Hof. A 50'kV double-circuit line goes to Jena. Local supplies are given at 10 kV and the stations of the group are inter- connected at this voltage.

		<Description>  Saarbr&#252;cken is the largest town in the Saar territory and a  most important industrial and coal-mining centre It is near the  southern boundary of the Saar area and is on a main railway line  which follows the valley of the River Saar to Trier. Saarbr&#252;cken  is a railway Junction for several branch lines serving the industrial  regions of the Saar and of Lorraine.  The coalfields of the Saar Basin, which extend mainly to the  North of the town, are among the largest in Europe and, together with  the rich iron-ore deposits of Lorraine, they yield raw material for  the highly-developed iron and steel industry in these regions. Several  iron and steel works are established in Saarbr&#252;cken itself. The  industries include a number of engineering works which, though  individually on a small scale, constitute in the aggregate a valuable  factor in the German war production. The industrial area extends  along the valley of the River Saar from the outskirts of V611 ingen  (5 miles to the West)to Brebach and N.usohtfidt, 3 miles to the East  of Saarbr&#252;cken The river Saar is navigable and is an important means  of transport for the products of this region. </Description>
		<Transportation>   Inland Harbour     Saarbr&#252;cken   (i)  This small inland harbour is in the  centre of the town and consists of one  large ere scent-shaped dock on the right  bank of the river Saar. Between this  dock and the river is an area known as  the Kohlenbahnhof with railway sidings  and loading facilities for coal etc.  In 1938 inward traffic amounted to 159,000  tons and outward traffic to 333,000 tons.Railway/SAARBR&#220;CKEN (Saar)(Contd)Railway JunctionSaarbr&#252;cken(2) A railway runs through the northern quarter of the town parallel with the river Saar. The main station is immediately North of the inland harbour. Five important lines meet in Saarbr&#252;cken: from Bingen to the North-west; from the Upper Rhineland through Kaiserslautern; from Strassburg through Zweibr&#252;cken to the South-east; from Metz to the West; and from Trier to the North-west of Saarbr&#252;cken. Two other minor branch lines serve the coalfields to the North of the town. All these lines meet inside the town area.  Marshalling Yards    Saarbr&#252;cken   (2) The marshalling yards, of which the largest are to the North-east of the main railway station, have a capacity for 6,000 wagons per 24 hours.

		<Description> The great iron ore deposits of Salzgitter just north of Goslar inthe Harz region and S.S.W. of Brunswick have been worked on a smallscale for many years, and, following the loss of Lorraine in 1919,their large scale operation was discussed by German geologists andmetallurgists. According to a report published in 1934 by the PrussianGeological Institute (Die Eisenerzvorrate des Deutschen Reiches)thesize of the deposits of ore that could be worked as an economicproposition was 35 million tons while there was a further 65 milliontons of ore that would require more favourable business conditions suchas cheap fireight and higher steel prices before it could be considered. These two categories of ore were at a depth of a few feet to nearly1,000 feet below the surface, but going to a depth of 3,300 feet atleast MX)million tons of ore were available. It has since been statedthat the estimate of volume of ore was much too low. Features commonto all the Salzgitter ores are their high phosphorus content, whichmakes them suitable for the basic Bessemer process, and their high silicacontent, which,, until the discovery by Brassert of .the means of usingacid burdens in blast furnaces, rendered them unsuitable for smeltingwithout the mixture of other ores. The greater part of the Salzgitterores have an extremely low iron content but among the best grades aresome with an iron content of about 40 per cent. Before the introductionof the Brassert process and the erection of the Reichswerke HermannGering, the best Salzgitter ores were mined to the extent of &#228; fewhundred thousand tons per annum by the nearby Ilseder H&#252;tte of Peine,which mixed them with the limey Peine ores, and by certain Ruhr workswhich mixed them with imported ores. Following the successful introduction in the mid-thirties of acidburdening at Corby in Northamptonshire where the ores are also sicilious,the large scale working of Salzgitter ores became a practical propositionprovided a works was erected on the spot. In pursuance of its policyof aiming at raw material self-sufficiency the Nazi Governmenttherefore decided to build such a plant and to link it by a specialcanal with the Mittelland Canal so as to provide cheap transport to andfrom the Ruhr. In the barges bringing the necessary coking coal forthe works' own coke ovens it was planned to send back Salzgitter oreto the Ruhr works. Thus, as a result of Government action, conditionswere created for the use of Salzgitter ores to an extent far exceedinganything conceived by the Prussian Geological substitute. There are now a number of iron ore mines in operation in this area.As already indicated some are of the surface or quarry type and nonerepresent suitable'objectives&#8221;</Description>

		<RubberandTyres>  Buna WerkeSchkopau (1 &#9658;)  The Schkopau plant of the Buna Werke G.m.b,H,  is the largest of the German synthetic rubber  plants, The original experimental works were  begun in 1956, and the present factory first  went into production in 1939 with a planned  fin^l 'capacity of 25,000 tons per annum.  Further expansions of the works during the war  have increased this capacity to at least 50,000  tons per annum. This exceeds the present  estimated. capacity of the Hhls works, the  second of the two leading German synthetic  rubber plants, which is described under the  heading Marl.

		<Description> Sch&#246;nebeck is on the left bank of the Elbe 9 miles South ofMagdeburg. South of and adjoining Sch&#246;nebeck is the settlement ofBad Salzelmen where there are extensive installations for curativebrine baths. Bad Salzelmen is included in the administrative areaof Sch&#246;nebeck. A chemical industry had developed in this town, which owed itsorigin to the brine deposits in the neighbourhood; this industry isnow making explosives. There is also a large ammunition factory andan aero-engine and aircraft components works of the Junkers concern. </Description>
		<AircraftandAero-Engines> Junkers Flugzeug &amp; Motorenwerke    Sch&#246;nebeck (2)   The Junkers works at Sch&#246;nebeck occupy   a large area to the East of the town and   are believed to be still in process of   expansion. In January 1944 a number of   now buildings were being erected. The   plant is engaged on the manufacture and   erection of control columns and engine-   bearings, under-carriages and other   aircraft and aero-engine components. Its   products are supplied mainly to the Junkers   works at Bernburg.  </AircraftandAero-Engines>
		<EngineeringandArmaments> Patronen Z&#252;ndh&#252;tchen      Bad Salzelmen (2)   The Patronen Z&#252;ndh&#252;tchen &amp; Metallwarenfabrik   A.G., are makers of cartridges, percussion   caps, detonators, and S.A.A. They have   also a section which makes machines and   machine tools for their own works. The   factory, in -which at least 2,000 workers   are employed occupies a large area to the   West of Bad Salzelmen. This company is   jointly owned by the Dynamit A.G-. and   Rheinmetall Borsig. </EngineeringandArmaments>
		<ChemicalsandExplosives> Lignose        Bad Salzelmen (2)   This factory is operated by the Lignose   Sprengstoff G.m.b.H. Ground reports have   suggested that the output of T. N. T. at   this plant is very large indeed. Some   reports put it as high as 60,000 tons   per annum. Examination of photographic   cover prior to the attack on the plant   early in 1944 suggests that on the basis   of the size of buildings, etc., the T. N. T.   capacity may be of the order of 40,000   tons per annum. There are two large   T. N. T. manufacturing units which appear   to be identical, and one smaller unit of   somewhat different layout. Some new   construction/SCH&#214;NEBECK Province Saxony)(Contd)  construction was then in hand, but it is not  yet clear whether this was intended for high-  explosives manufacture or not. The photographs  suggest that, in addition to T. N. T. amatol  is also prepared in this plant by mixing some  part of the T. N. T. production with ammonium  nitrate. This may be the explanation of the  very high figures for T. N. T. output which  have been given from some sources.  Ground sources have suggested that there are  two factories making explosives at Schbnebeck.  This is not confirmed by air photographs, and  it is suggested that the second explosives  factory reported is in fact the Patronen  Z&#252;ndh&#252;tchen und Metallwarenfabrik, which is  a fuse-making establishment in the neigh-  bourhood., and which has mounded buildings  for the storage of explosives and detonators.  The high-explosives factory lies in open  country on rising ground on the south bank  of the river Elbe, about 2 km. due west of  Schbnebeck railway station, and 1J km. south-  west from the river bank.  Ground reports have stated that shells are  also filled in this factory, but air  photographs do not confirm this, and it would  be very unusual practice to use an explosives  factory for filling weapons. It is probable,  however, that there is a filling factory in  the immediate neighbourhood.  The factory was almost completely destroyed  only in 1944, probably as a by-product of the  raid of January 21/22, 1944 on Magdeburg.Chemische Werke      Sch&amp;nebeck (-)  The Chemische Werke Schbnebeck A.G. are  makers of heavy chemicals, including hydro-  chloric acid, sodium sulphate and finished  materials for the ceramic industry.

		<Description>  Schramberg is in the central area of the Black Forest 30 milesNorth-east of Freiburg. It is at the terminus of a small branchrailway from Schiltach which in its turn is connected at Hausach withthe main railway line from Offenburg through the Black Forest toDonaueschingen. As with many similar remote towns in the Black Forest,watch and clock making is the traditional industry. In the case ofSchramberg, however, the development of the firm of Junghans has giventhe town outstanding importance in this branch. Apart from a few minorwatch makers, the activities of Schramberg are entirely concerned withthe Junghans works. </Description>
		<EngineeringandArmaments>  Junghans       Schramberg (1)  The Gebr. Junghans A.G. Uhrenfabriken are  the largest individual firm of watch and  clock makers in the Blade Forest area. In  peacetime they employed some 5,000 workers  and were capable of producing watches and  clocks at the rate of 27,000 daily. The  parent works of the concern are in Schramberg  and include, in addition to the large watch-  making factory, a section devoted to the  manufacture of the precision tools required  in this industry. a separate saw mill and  woodworking factory, also in Schramberg,  prepares the wooden casings for the clocks.  .  The works has its own hydro-electric power  plant. A branch factory in Lehengericht, 5  miles North of Schramberg, makes watch  springs. There is a second smaller watch  factory in Schwenningen 15 miles to the  South East of Schramberg, and a components  factory in Rotteriburg 30 miles to the North-  east of Schramberg.  The factories in Schramberg, which are now  said to number three separate plantF, are  believed to employ some 1J,000 workers and^  in addition to a fairly wide range of  precision instruments, are now largely  turned over to the manufacture of fuzes.     /TogetherSCHRAMBERG (conti. )  Junghans (contd.)  Together with the firm Gebr. Thiel df Ruhla   in Thuringia, this production of fuzes   is reported to amount to 100,000 daily.  There is an apprentices' school in Schramberg   where up to 200 mechanics and watch makers   are under training. During the latter half   of 1943 the number of foreign workers, which   had hitherto been small, was increasing   continually, mostly Frenchmen and Ukrainians   of both sexes being engaged.  Although the firm's payroll has increased   from 5,000 to 13,000 in the course of the   war it is unlikely that the number of   workers actually employed in the Junghans   factories has increased to any major extent   because they were already working to   capacity before the war. It is assumed   that seme 7,000 to 8,000 workers are employed   by sub-contractors or are "home workers'.   &#8212;0O0SCHWABACH/</EngineeringandArmaments>

		<Description> Schweinfurt is in the North-western area of Bavaria on the Northbank of the River Main, 25 miles North-west of W&amp;rzburg. It is on therailway route from Northern Germany to Stuttgart and on the East toWest line from Bamberg to Mainz and the Rhine valley. The Main is already navigable for heavy barges as far asAschaffenburg, but it is possible that the project to connect the Mainwith the Danube has already progressed upstream beyond Schweinfurt,in which case the hitherto small inland harbour will have increased inimportance. Schweinfurt is the largest centre of the German ball bearingindustry and normally produces well over half the total requirements.This manufacture is carried on mainly in four large factories whichare grouped round the main railway station on the South-westernoutskirts of the town. The technical equipment and individual skillrequired in this industry, on which many engineering and armamentbranches depend have been developed over a long period and have madeSchweinfurt a highly specialised industrial community which it isdifficult to transplant or replace. As a result of several bombing attacks very severe damage hasbeen done to the four principal factories. </Description>
		<Transportation> Inland Harbour     Schweinfurt (3)   There is a small harbour on the North bank  of the River Main in the industrial district  of Schweinfurt to the West of the town centre.  This harbour, which is served by railway  sidings, is close to the V.K.F. plant.   Until 1939 only the smaller barges could proceed  up the Main beyond Aschaffenburg, but it is  possible that the Main-Danube canal project  is now sufficiently advanced for heavier  traffic to reach Schweinfurt and Bamberg.Sdhweidnitz (3)        Railway/SCH/ffiINFURT (Bavaria)(Contd) Railway Junction     Schweinfurt (3)   The main railway station at Schweinfurt is   West of the town centre in the industrial   quarter and in the midst of the chief   factories which are mentioned below. The   main line down the Main valley from Bamberg   to W&#252;rzburg passes through Schweinfurt, and   immediately West of the main railway station   an important branch diverges and leads   Northwards to Meiningen. A minor branch   leads South-east to Gerolzhofen. .Railway Repair Shops     Schweinfurt (3)   These are medium-sized repair shops which   undertake the repair and maintenance of   locomotives and goods wagons.

		<EngineeringandArmaments>  V .K.F. When in full production the group of Schweinfurt factories belonging to this concern formed by far the most important unit in the German ball-bearing industry. The V.K.F. group employed at least 10,000 workers. The chief plants are described below. This concern extended its range of production during the war to include tape n-ro Iler, barrel-roller and the heaviest types of bearings,  V .K.F. Werk I (Schweinfurter Pr&#228;zisions-   Schweinfurt (1)   Kugellagerwerke Fichte1 &amp; Sachs,   W&amp;lzlager Abteilung) This factory was purchased from the Schweinfurt firm of Fichtel &amp; Sachs in 1929. In 1938, 3,000 to 3500 workers were employed. It produced all types of bearing, including the majority of the German output of precision bearings, and concentrated particularly on the finishing and assembling processes, receiving part of its requirements of semi- products from V.K.F. Werk XI and other sources.  V .K.F. Werk II (Deutsche Gusstahlkugel &amp;   Schweinfurt (1)M    Maschinenfabrik A.G. vorm.    Fries &amp; Hbpf linger) This factory was also acquired in 1929. It produced all types of bearings, and was also engaged in the production of balls and the machining of races for Werk I, where the finishing and final assembly was carried out. 4500 to50&#176;&#176; workers were employed in 1938, It is believed that the plant has been extended since &#2404; the war by taking over neighbouring premises. In addition to standard varieties of bearing, these two works have also, in recent years, taken up the manufacture of the heaviest types of bearings, as well as taper-roller and barrel-roller bearings. These had formerly been imported from Sweden.  Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.nub.H.    Schweinfurt (2) The section of the V.K.F. concern known as the Deutsche Star Kugelhalter G.m.b.H, was before the war engaged exclusively on the production of ball-bearing cages. They supplied these to the other ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt and to the open market. Approximately 1,000 workers ware employed.  The priority ratings are based op the pre- raid value of these objectives.KugeIfiseher/SGBflSINFURT (Contd)  Kugelfischer (Erste Automatische Gusstahlfabrik Schweinfurt (1+)   vormals F. Fischer)  The Schweinfurt plant of the Kugelfischer  Schoefer A.G. combine is immediately North  of the railway line and main station. It  is the largest single factory in the German  ball bearing industry and produced all types  of ball and roller bearings, with the  exception of the heaviest industrial  bearings, before the war. 5,000 to 6,000  hands were employed in 1938, but figure had  risen to 7,000 by 1939 ^he size of the  works has been much increased since the  outbreak of war. It is, therefore, the  largest individual factory in the German  ball bearing industry, and reports received  prior to the air attacks suggested that as  many as 12,000 workers were employed.Fichtel &amp; Sachs      Ernst Sachs (1)      Str.  The ball bearing factory belonging to this  firm was taken over by the V.K.F. and is now  Werk I of that concern as mentioned above  The firm of Fichtel &amp; Sachs, .though possibly  now affiliated with the V.K.F. concern, still  retains its identity and continues to operate  under its own name. The works make light  weight motorcycles, motor boat engines,  cycle hubs and other motor vehicle components,  including the F &amp; S patent clutch which is  widely used in the German motor industry. A  limited range of small ball-bearings for use  in their own products is produced in the  section of the plant retained by Fichtel &amp;  Sachs. The works has been enlarged since  1939 and reports suggest that the new workshops  are mainly engaged on the manufacture of motor  vehicle components for the open market and  small arms components and ammunition.  ana tolQaireg  Deutsche Gelatine      Schweinfurt (3)  The Deutsche Gelatine Fabriken, whose works  are North East of the main railway station,  manufacture gelatine in powder and in sheet  form for food and technical purposes. The  products include photographic gelatine for  film and paper emulsions, and a special  gelatine for use as a protecting separative for  photographic films. This firmis the best  known producer of photographic gelatine in  Germany. Some 800 workers are employed.  The priority ratings are based on the pre-  raid value of these objectives.SCHELM (Westphalia)    See under Hagen     &#8212; ' .1</EngineeringandArmaments>

Not only   is nitro-cellulose made in large quantities   for the production of celluloid-type plastics,   but a variety of other plastic materials,   among/SIEIBURG (Rhineland)(ContdJ.  among which laminated articles made fron  bakelite are perhaps the most important,  are also made here. It is quite likely,  that some explosive nitrocellulose is still  manufactured here, and indeed this view  is supported by the examination of air  photographs. It is difficult to estimate  what part of the nitrocellulose capacity  is available for explosives manufacture.  The total installed capacity represents  about 12,000 tons per annum, but the  majority of this will certainly be used  for plastics manufacture.  The factory is important as being one of  the largest producers of detonators in  Germany. It introduced the manufacture of  lead azide detonators in aluminium caps.  Even before the war the production of these  detonators was running at the rate of about  120 million per annum, and there is little  doubt that it has been increased since. The  factory prepares its own raw materials for  detonators, having a sodium azide plant with  an output in excess of 160 tons per annum.  The factory is situated 13 miles south-east of  Cologne. </ChemicalsandExplosives>

A branch  line leads Southeast from Soest, and  other minor branch railways serve the  district to the North-west between Soest  and Haram. Marshalling lard     Soest  (2)   The marshalling yard is situated across  the North border of the town, and has  capacity for handling 4,4^0 wagons per  24 hours. It is an exceptionally busy yard,  on one of the main routes to and from the  Ruhr. N.xt to the route through Hamm from  Berlin, the route through Soest between  Breslau, Leipzig, Swindm&#252;nde, and the Ruhr  probably hamiles the heaviest traffic in  Germany. Soest is the main supply marshalling  yard dealing with traffic to and from the  Ruhr from Central and E-stern Germany and would  bear the main weight of all the Ruhr traffic  if Hamm were seriously damaged. Railway Repair Shops     Soest  (3)   These repair shops, which are #est of the  marshalling yards, undertake the repair and  maintenance of locomotives and other rolling  stock, and employ some 1,5^0 workers.  </Transportation>

Itis connected by rail with the great industrial centres of the Ruhr,but is not in itself an important railway centre. Solingen is known as'the Sheffield of Germany&#8221; on account ofits world-famous light engineering industry which is mainly concernedwith the production of cutting machines, tools, knives, scissors, andsurgical instruments. Bicycles and components for motor vehicles andsmall arms are also manufactured. The suburbs of the city - Wald to the North-west, Ohligs to theWest, and Gr&amp;frath. to the North - are also industrialised, and someof the larger engineering plants are to be found in these areas. The outlying settlements of the Solingen district are, for themost part, non-industrial, with the exception of Haan whose fair-sized engineering works were mainly engaged on the production of cutlery. </Description>

A   report dated 1938 states that while over 400,000   square metres of land were allocated to the   factory, only some 22,000 square metres had   been used for buildings at that time.   Photographic reconnaissance of July, 1942,   shows that the factory has now been much   enlarged. Its chief function is plainly the   manufacture of T. N.

It seems likely that penthrite or   tetryl are also made at this factory, and   there are certain buildings similar to those   usually associated with the manufacture of   detonators.</ChemicalsandExplosives>

		<Description> Stettin is at the mouth of the River Oder and is Germany'slargest Baltic port. It is the nearest port to Berlin, which lies84 miles to the South-west. It has direct rail communications withBerlin, Frankfurt (Oder), and Danzig, and through the River Oder isjoined up to the main North German inland-waterway system. It playsan important part in the seaborne supply arrangements for the EasternFront. The central area of Stettin is a compact mass composed mainlyof dwelling houses and offices. The industrial area extends alongthe river from the dock area in the south-eastern quarter of thecity northwards along the left bank to Gutzlow. Kost of theimportant industrial plants are in this area. The main industry of Stettin is connected with its shipyards.No large vessels are built here, but there is considerable activityin the building and fitting-out of submarines, mine sweepers, navalescort vessels, and tank landing craft. The shipyard area is inthe neighbourhood of Grabow, which is on the left bank of the riverone mile to the North of the main railway bridge. The Vulkanshipyards have been considerably extended during the war. Oppositethe shipbuilding yards is the Bredow Werder, a large island in thechannel of the Oder, which is in process of being converted intoan industrial area and naval base. At the South end of this islanda large dock basin has been excavated. The port or dock area is onthe right bank of the Oder immediately North of the marshalling yards,and in the neighbourhood of the docks is a large concentration ofwarehouses, timber yards, oil depots, and small factories.WSTETTIN (Pomerania)(Contd.) In Pommerensdorf, a southern suburb of Stettin, there arechemical works and a large electric power station, which aredescribed below.An important factory lying outside the general industrial areais the Stoewer Werke A.G-., which is situated to the West of the townin the suburb of Westend. The outlying district of P&#246;litz, 8 miles to the North of Stettin,contains an important synthetic-oil plant and an electricgenerating station. These are included with Stettin in the listbelow. The town of Altdamm, which lies to the South-east of Stettin,is dealt with separately. </Description>
		<Transportation> Port Area      Stettin  (2)   The port and dock area are opposite the centre   of the town on the right bank of the Oder.   There are two harbours with rail sidings which   lead from the marshalling yards immediately to   the South East. The Freihafen, one of the docks   immediately opposite to the city centre, has   some of the largest dock warehouses in Europe,   including a large grain elevator. The whole   dock area, including the island known as the   Silber-Wiese, at the point where the main   railway crosses the Oder, is closely built   with warehouses, timber yards, saw mills, oil   storage depots, and small factories.   Stettin is an important transhipment centre   for the Upper Silesian coal which is conveyed   in barges down the Oder direct from the   coalfields. Railway Centre     Stettin  (2)   The main line from Berlin, which continues   beyond Stettin north-eastwards parallel with   the Baltic coast, forms a direct route from   Berlin to Danzig. Other lines radiate from   Stettin north-westwards to Stralsund, south-   wards to K&#252;strin, and northwards via Gollnow   round the Eastern side of the Stettiner Haff   to Swinemfinde. Three other minor branch lines   serve the agricultural districts to the West   and South-west of the town. Marshalling Yards      Stettin  (3)   The marshalling yard has a capacity for handling   2500 wagons per 24- hours. It is connected   with the chief goods station which hamiles   traffic arriving on the Oder for despatch to   Berlin, and goods from Berlin and Breslau for   shipment to the Baltic ports. It is also the   clearing station for the eastern coastal   districts of the Baltic.</Transportation>

		<Description>  Stuttgart, the capital of W&#252;rttemberg, is the most importantindustrial town in Southern Germany. It lies in a valleysurrounded by wooded hills which open out in the East into thevalley of the river N.ckar, The town has grown in size consider-ably since the end of the last century, the development being' due mainly to the engineering industry consisting principally oflight and electrical engineering. Together with the adjoiningsuburb of Zuffenhausen, Feuerbach forms one of the chief industria-lised quarters of the Stuttgart district. The second industrialarea is in Cannstatt and Affinster, which are to the North of thecity centre and on the left bank of the river N.ckar, This areaincludes an important ball-bearing works, the town's electricpower station, and several precision-engineering works. A thirdindustrial district is East of the city centre and on the rightbank of the river, extending Southeastward from Untert&#214;rkheimup the river valley to E: slingen. The highly important main plantof the Daimler-Benz concern is in Untert&#252;rkheim, which alsocontains large marshalling yards and railway-repair shops. Halfwaybetween Untert&#252;rkheim and E: slingen are the "Index&#8221; works ofHahn A Tessky, one of Germany's leading makers of machine tools.The manufacture of machine tools and measuring instruments is ahighly-developed industry in Stuttgart and also in the neighbouringsettlements of E: slingen, 4 miles to the South-east, It ischaracteristic of Stuttgart, as indeed of the whole of W&#252;rttemberg,that in normal times industry tends to remain in the hands of alarge number of medium-sized or small firms. This is particularlythe case with machine tools, and it is, therefore, not possibleto include all the numerous firms which in the aggregate makeStuttgart a vital factor in the German engineering industry,Stuttgart is an important railway centre and is on the mainroutes from the North to Zurich and from Munich to Karlsruheand France. </Description>
		<Transportation> Railway Centre     Stuttgart   (2)  The main railway station is situated in the  centre of the town and is one of the largest  terminal railway stations in Germaiy. Stuttgart  lies on two important trunk routes, from  North Germany to Zurich, and from Munich to  Karlsruhe and France, Two branch lines lead  East and West to Schw&#196;bisch-Gm&#252;nd and B&amp;blingen  respectively, and several minor branches serve  the neighbouring industrial settlements,  including Sindelfingen, Kornwestheim and  Ludwigsburg, Marshalling Yards     Untert&#246;rkhei (F)  These marshalling yards are capable of  handling up to 2,200 wagons per 24 Goods Yards  The principal goods yards occupy a  area to the North-east of the main  station and have extensive storagehours.

Railway Repair Shops   Stuttgart   (2)  There are railway-repair shops at Bad  Cannstatt and Stuttgart-Nord. At Bad  Cannstatt the repair of all kinds of  rolling stock, including passenger  coaches, is undertaken, and at Stuttgart-  Nord the repair of goods wagons. Some  2,000 workers are employed in Bad Caristatt  and 500 in Stuttgart-Nord repair shops  alone. In addition to the above there are  also repair shops employing some 900  workers at E: slingen. </Transportation>
		<PublicUtilityServices> Power Station     Stuttgart   (2)  This thermal power station is situated  in M&#252;nster, a northern suburb of Cannstatt.  It is owned by the Stuttgart Corporation  and has an installed capacity of 87 MW. In  addition to the general town supply, power  is delivered for railway traction. There  are no important long-distance supplies'  An adjacent 6/110 kV substation is owned by  Elektrizit&#228;ts-Versorgung W&#252;rttemberg A.G.  and provides supplies for traction locally  and via a 110-kV transmission line through  Plochingen to Pasing to serve the electrified  Stuttgart-Ulm-Augsburg-Munich railway line  (single-phase circuit).  A substation for 3/10 kV transmits supplies  locally. Medium-voltage lines connect to  Degerloch and Obert&#252;rkheim. Power Station     Marbach  (2)  The Marbach plant consists- of a large thermal  station, begun in 1938 and completed since the  outbreak of war, and a small hydro station,  and has an installed capacity of 108 MW. It  is situated on the river N.ckar about 10 miles  North of Stuttgart and this relatively remote  location was probably chosen mainly as an  air-raid precaution. It is believed that  practically the whole electrical output is  supplied to the grid at the 220-kV Hoheneck  substation and the 110-kV Obert&#252;rkheim sub-  station from whence a part is transmitted to  Stuttgart. The small hydro station has an  installed capacity of 3 MW.  An outdoor substation contains 4 double-circuit  110-kV lines, of which one, possibly two,  connects to Obert&#252;ikheim and two to Hoheneck.        /SubstationSTUTTGART (contd.)   Substation      Hoheneck  (2)    This important substation is situated 2   miles South-west of the Harbach generating    station. It is being extended and    identification is therefore uncertain. The    station is on the 220-kV (planned 380&#8212;kV)    long-distance line which links the water-    power stations of the mountainous regions    on the southern frontiers of Germany with    the Ruhr industrial area.    There are three adjoining sections for    220 kVF 110 kV and 60 kV respectively.    Each section has duplicate busbars.    Two 380/220-kV circuits connect to Rheinau    and two to Herbertingen.    One 220-kV circuit connects to Ellwangen.    Two (possibly)110-kV circuits connect to    Pforzheim and two (possibly)to Heilbronn.    Two double 110-kV circuits are under    construction to Haibach station.    Two 60-kV circuits go to Heilbronn, two to    Pleideslheim, and one to Enzberg.    It is believed that there are transformers    for voltages lower than 60 kV.   Gas Works'      Stuttgart   (3)    The municipal ^is works made 3,100 million    cubic feet of gas in 1936. Supplies are    given to a large number of localities    around Stuttgart. </PublicUtilityServices>

Zuffenhausen (3)    The Zuffenhausen worts of this company is    mainly engaged on experimental wort, which    is carried out on behalf of its holding    company, the Heinkel aircraft concern. The    research and experimental work is chiefly    connected with the development of low-    powered aero-engines, aero-engine components,    and, in particular, crankshafts.    The Hirth Motoren G.m.b.H. occupies the    same site, and works.in close co-operation    with the aoove firm. The ground reports    suggest that since early 194J0 approximately    1,000 workers have been employed at the    Zuffenhausen factory, and there are indications    that, in addition to research and experimental    work, a small range of aero-engine components    manufactured here.   Elektronmetall G.m.b.H'    Bad Cannstatt (3)    This firm specialises in the manufacture of    pistons and piston rings, brakes, and shock    absorbers for the aircraft industry. Other    products include light-metal components    for aircraft instruments, particularly radio    equipment.   Leichtmetallbau G.m.b.H.    Bad Cannstatt (3)    It is believed that this firm employs    3/400 workers on the manufacture of air-    craft components, in particular shock    absorbers and components for aircraft    undercarriages, brakes, and other aircraft    equipment.   J.Ebersp&#228;cher      E: slingen   (3)    I    This factory has been considerably enlarged    since 1939, and has acquired at least one    of the neighbouring factory sites, apait    frcm erecting two new workshops adjacent    to its old premises. It is believed to be    engaged mainly on the manufacture of air-    craft components and cylinder-baffling    silencers, air filters, and other aero-engine    components. Other products of the firm are    components for flame throwers, and reports    suggest that a number of other firms in    E: slingen supply Ebersp&#228;cher with major and    minor components for flame throwers,    indicating that assembly of flame throwers    is likely to be undertaken by them.         /Daimler-BenzSTUTTGART (contd.)   Daimler-Benz A.G.     Untert&#220;rkheim (1)    The principal pre-war activity of this    company was the manufacture of motor vehicles,    and it is believed that the major part    of the very extensive old Daimler-Benz works    at Untert&#252;rkheimis still employed on work    connected with the ijiotor-vehicle industry.    This aspect of the Daimler-Benz production    is dealt with below, under "Engineering and    Armaments", and the following relates    exclusively to those pai'ts of the works    which are believed to be engaged on aero-    engine work.    For several years prior to the war the Daimler-    Benz company undertook the development of    aero-engines, and prototypes were built and    tested at this works. It is thought that up    to 1939 no large-scale production of aero-    engines was undertaken, except at the branch    factories at Genshagen and Marienfelde, near    Berlin. Reports suggest that these two    factories were supplied with components    from Untert&#252;rkheim. It is not definitely    known when the complete construction of aero-    engines at Untert&#220;rkheim commenced, but it    seems probable that it was during the early    part of 1942. Up to the end of that year    aero-engines erected at Untert&#252;rkheim were    transported to Sindelfingen for testing,    but since then the Untert&#220;rkheim works has    been very greatly extended, and it is clear    from reconnaissance photographs that most of    the sections are connected with the production    of aero-engines, which is now taking place    at Stuttgart on a large scale. Several series    of engine test-beds have been erected, and    it is believed that Untert&#220;rkheim now represents    one of the principal production centres for    Daimler-Benz engines. </AircraftandAero-Engines>
		<EngineeringandArmaments>   Daimler-Benz A.G.     Untert&#220;rkheim (1)    Owing to its interests in other industries    (particularly the aero-engine industry - see    aoove)the Daimler-Benz company is the    largest motor-vehicle concern in Germany.    In terms of output the Untert&#220;rkheim plant    is second only to Opel, its 1938 production    figures being 20,000 passenger cars and    6,000 commercial .vehicles. There is reason    to believe that the manufacture of commercial    vehicles, particularly lorries, has increased    considerably in the course of the war, and    that there has been a corresponding decline    in the output of cars, production of which    is confined mainly to military types. Several    sections of the Untert&#220;rkheim plant are    engaged on the manufacture of components for    motor vehicles, which are partly supplied to    /theirSTUTTGART (contd.) Daimler-Benz A.G. (contd.)    their branch works at Gaggenau and    Sindelfingen. No definite information    regarding the number of workers at    present employed at Untert&#252;rkheimis    available, but ground reports suggest    that the total is approximately 20,000,    including the very large number of    workers employed in the aero-engine    sections described above (under " Aircraft    and Aero-Engines ").   Robert Bosch A.G.     a)Feuerbach (1+        b)Stuttgart- (1)          Milit&#228;r Str.    The principal works of this firmis at    Feuerbach, a suburb of Stuttgart. A    second works in this area is in the    middle of Stuttgart (west of the main    railway station)but although it has    been repeatedly extended since 1939 it    is not as important as the Feuerbach    works.    The outstanding value of the Bosch works    to the German armament industry is their    very large output of fuel injection    pumps, magnetos, sparking plugs, and    batteries, as well as the usual Bosch    range of electrical accessories for    internal combustion engines. In addition    the Feuerbach and Stuttgart works make    a wide range of other electrical    appliances such as components for search-    lights, head-lamps,etc., but there are,    of course, only of secondary importance.    Bosch operate a subsidiary factory at    Klein-Machnow near and also an affiliated    factory in G-erman occupied territory but    it is estimated that the Stuttgart    factories of Bosch still account for more    than half of Germany's total requirements    of fuel injection pumps, magnetos, sparking    plugs, and other electrical accessories    for internal combustion engines.    It is estimated that the Feuerbach works    employs some 20,000 workers and that a    further 10,010 hands are engaged at Stuttgart-    Milit&#228;r Str.   Zeiss Ikon (Contessa)   Domhalderstr. (2)    The Stuttgart works of the Zeiss Ikon A.G.    of Dresdeh are known as the Contessa Werke.    This branch specialises in the manufacture    of cameras and photographic appliances of    all kinds. It is now believed that their    range of products has been widened to include    the grinding and polishing of optical lenses    and a wide range of optical instruments.    Some 2,000 workers were reported to be em-    ployed in 1942.     /Fortuna WerkeSTUTTGART (contd.)   Fortuna Werke    Pr&#228;gstr,  (3)    The Fortuna Werke Spezialmaschinen-    fabrik A.

The second yard includes a large area of land     also on the right bank of the River Swine     between the aerodrome and the river. This     area appears to have been reclaimed and well     camouflaged. In 1942 the yards began     constructing large numbers of armed drifters.     These are of typical fishing-boat design and     each boat mounts two guns of 75 nan. a&#8319;a 20 mm,     (or 37 mm.)respectively. In 1943 21 drifters     had been completed and 18 were on the slips.         tabaW     TABABZ (Thuringia)     See Waltershausen</Shipbuilding>

		<Description>  Ulmis the second largest town in W&#252;rttemberg. It lies  on the left bank of the Danube and on the main railway line fron  Stuttgart to Augsburg and Munich. It is the Junction for an  important branch line leading South to Friedrichshafen, and  for three minor branch lines serving the surrounding district.  The central area of the town is dominated by the famous  "Munster&#8221; which is believed to be the largest Gothic  Cathedral in the world; its steeple is 528 feet high  and it is thus the highest steeple in Europe. The most  important industrial undertaking in Ulmis the Magirus A.G.  This fiim specialises in fire-fighting equipment, but has now  also attained a high degree of importance as a producer of  A.F.V&#8216;s and heavy aimoured vehicles. There is a non-ferrous  metal fabricating plant, which is described below, and several  other engineering works, some of which are working exclusively  for Magirus. There is also a small textile and leather  industry. The Messerschnitt aircraft assembly works at Leipheim  10 miles east of Ulm, are included in the list given below. </Description>
		<Transportation>  Railway Centre     Ulm    (2)   The main railway line from Stuttgart enters   Ulm from the North-east and, after curving   Southwards, passes through the main railway   station, which is on the western side of   the central city area, crosses the Danube   and leads in an easterly direction to   Augsburg and Munich. A branch line from   Signaringen and South-western W&#252;rttemberg   enters the city area from the North-west   and Joins the Stuttgart line immediately   north of the main railway station. The   direct line from Ulm to Friedrichshafen   diverges from the Munich route between   the main station and the railway bridge   and leads south-westwards along the   left lead from Ulm North-east to   Heidenheim and South along the River Ille   to Memmingen.  Marshalling Yards      Ulm  (3)   The chief marshalling yards are to the   North-west of the main railway station   and inside the main curve made by the   railway line from Signarlngen before it   enters the central city area. They are   capable of handling up to 2,400 wagons per   24 hours. There is a large goods   station adjacent to these marshalling   yards and a second smaller goods station   half a mile to the East alongside the   line to Stuttgart.  Railway Repair Shops    Ulm  (3)   The railway repair shops, which are at   the Eastern end of the marshalling yards,areULM (continued)    are "believed to undertake the repair   of goods wagons and other rolling   stock. It has however been reported   that they have new been considerably   extended and were expected to begin   the construction of rolling stock   during the winter 194-2&#8212;43. </Transportation>

It is on the river Blau, a   small tributary stream which flows   through the city and joins the Danube   near the Ulm railway station. An   indoor substation connects the station   by a 55-kV long-distance line to the   RWE substation at Herbertingen for the   main purose of importing rather than   exporting electricity.    Supplies are given locally to consumers   in the Ulm area.  Gasworks         Ulm (3)    The municipal gasworks made 217 million   cubic feet of gas in 1931.  </PublicUtilityServices>

It is believed to        /haveULM (continued)  have concentrated on the assembly  of large gliders (Me.323s)and  possibly also other Messerschmitt  types. In 1943 the output at  Leipheim was reported as 10 Me.  323's per month, and in addition the  repair of an average of three gliders  per week. Sane 1500 workers were  said to be engaged in June 1943, but  later reports suggest that this  number had been increased. Reconnaissance  photographs taken at the end of April  1944 showed considerable bomb damage  and for the first time Me. 262 fighters  were identified at this works.

		<EngineeringandArmaments> Magirus WerkeUlmUlmUlm(Werk(l)(Werkll)(Werklll)to to to  The Magirus Werke are, together with Mets of Karlsruhe, the chief German specialists in fire-fighting vehicles, ladders and heavy and auxiliary equip- ment. In 1936 the firm was taken over by the Klockner- Humboldt- Deutz concern and the former Magirus company was liquidated. It is, however, still usual to refer to the works in Ulm as the Magirus Werke. In addition to their normal fire-fighting equipment, they are now believed to have taken up the production of AF.V's or tanks on a large scale, and a number of reports indicate that Magirus has become a highly important supplier of heavy armaments.  Magirus have two works in Ulm proper (WerkI and Werk II)and a third large plant has now been established in N.u Ulm, the quarter of the town which lies on the right bank of the Danube.  The works referred to as Werk I are in the Schillerstrasse close to the railway bridge across the Danube. The second works are in the Bl^ubeurenstrasse in the Western suburb of S&#246;flingen. They occupy a large area South of the Western end of the marshalling yards and are bisected by the small stream know as the Blau which flows through the town and into the Danube near the railway bridge.  There are several other factories (saw mills, roof-felting makers, a rayon mill, and a fertiliser factory)grouped round the Magirus works area. It is /thought.ULK (continued)Magirus (contd.)thought probable that these twooriginal works (Werk I and Werk II)are still mainly engaged on theproduction of fire-engines andequipment, particularly in view ofthe severe damage to Metz of Karls-ruhe, and that the A.F.V's or tankproduction is carried out mainlyby the new works in the N.u Ulm area.One report, however, indicates thatsome of the tanks are assembled atWerk II. Other products of thisUlm factory are reported to be Dieselengines, lorries, light transport-column vehicles, tractors, smoke-screen devices, propellers andshafts and other components formidget submarines. Reports suggestthat in 1945 chenillettes, smalltracked vehicles for reconnaissance,were being turned out. Reports statethat up to 1944 the new works mainlybuilt semi-tracked amoured cars,but that the serial production oftanks was expected to begin shortly.The number of workers employed byMarigus has been variously reported,and is certainly well over 15,000in totalUlmer SchraubenfabrikBlaubeuren str.

		<Description> Walchensee is a small village on the Western shore of theWalchen See, 45 miles South of Munich in the Bavarian Alps. Thereis an important hydro electric scheme at Walchensee. </Description>
		<PublicUtilityServices>  Hydro Scheme       Walchensee (1)  The Walchensee hydro scheme, which was built  in 1924, uses the water power of the Walchen  See and the Kochel See, one mile to the North.  There is a 670 ft. head between these two lakes.  The natural inflow of the Walchen See is augmented  by obstructing part of the water of the river Isar  by means of a diversionary canal from Krtnn 6 miles  South of Walchensee to the Southwestern corner of  the lake. Between the two lakes the water flows  for J mile through a tunnel. The penstock leading  into the Kochel See is 1,450'ft long and comprises  6 pipe lines tape ring in diameter from 7^- ft. at  the top to 6 ft at the bottom. The installed  capacity of this hydro-electric station is 124 W.  It contains special generating plant for supply to  the German State Railways, as well as plant for  general supply. Water supply is at a maximum  in spring, when the snow melts, and at a mini rm m  during the frosts of winter.-&#8212;</PublicUtilityServices>

		<PublicUtilityServices>  Hydro Scheme       Waldeck (1)  This electric power scheme is based on the damming   of the River Eder, an undertaking which was first   put into operation in 1914. The dam near Waldeck   impounds 202 million tons of water in the Edersee,   and serves three main purposes, namely: to store   water for improving navigation on the River Weser,   to control flood waters, and to stpply power for   electricity. There are 4 generating stations.   The Hemfurth I station near the Edersee dam has a   capacity of 14 W. Hemfurth II, one ndle downstream,   which is equipped with puaped-storage plant. has a   capacity of 18 W. To compensate for the irregular   flow through the turbines of the two Hemfurth stations,/a weirWA L D E C K (Continued.)   a weir, the Affoldern, 5 miles downstream, has been   built to create a compensating reservoir The   generating station at Affoldern has a capacity of   5 W. Finally, in 1933, a large pumped-storage   station was built on the bank of the Affoldern   compensating reservoir which was used as a lower   reservoir, the upper reservoir being artificially   constructed on the flat top of the Peterskopf   Mountain in the Bringhausen Forest This generating   station, known as the Bringhausen station, has a   capacity of 120 MW and is used for meeting peak   loads and emergencies The Bringhausen jumpedr-   storage systemis one of the largest of its kind   The upper reservoir is 980 feet above the generating   station, and has an effective water content of   760,000 tons. The penstock consists of two parallel   pipes 3,150'feet long, tapering in diameter from   8 feet at the top to 7 feet at the bottom. There is   an adjoining table railway   The Eder dam was breached by air attack in May 1943   and the reservoir largely depleted of water, while   the power stations escaped serious damage. The reservoir   has since been drained as part of the reconstruction   work now in progress.</PublicUtilityServices>

		<Description>  Waldshut lies on the Upper Rhine close to the Swiss border,  approximately halfway between Schaffhausen and Basle. Waldshut  occupies a central position in the chain of electric power  stations which form the Upper Rhine hydro scheme. A second  hydro scheme utilises the water of the Schluchsee, which lies  12 miles North of Waldshut. Both these electric power stations  are described below under </Description>
		<PublicUtilityServices> .    Hydro Scheme    Upper Rhine (1)   The Upper Rhine hydro scheme utilises the    water-power resources of. a 90- miles stretch    of the River Rhine between the Schaffhausen    Rhine falls and Basle. This scheme embraces    a system of 15 hydro electric power stations    of which some are under Swiss control.    Waldshut lies geographically in the centre    of this chain &#246;f stations. The German-    controlled stations are Rheinau (35 MW),    Eglisau (35 MW), Reckingen (36 MW), Waldshut-    Kadelburg (37 MW), Albbruck-Dogern (72 MW),    Laufenburg (68 MW), S&#228;ckingen (45-75 MW),    Riburg-Schwttrstadt (104 MW), Rheinfelden    (65 MW), and Augst-Wyhlen (51 MW). The Swiss-    controlled stations are Schaffhausen (16 MW),    Rheinfall (100 MW), Beznau (25 W), Klingnau    (35 MW), and Birsfelden near Basle (50 mW).    Special features of this hydro scheme are the    unusually constant flow of Lake Constance,    and the fact that the maximum flow is in    July, and the minimumin Februa, ry, owing to    the freezing in winter of the hi^i Alpine    water sources which feed this part of the    river. It is thus possible to maintain a    high electrical output all the year round,    with a maximum value in summer, when most    other hydro schemes are obliged to operate    with reduced output./TheWALDSHUT (contd.)  Hydro Sehen' (contd.)  The scheme has been jointly developed by  the German and Swiss Governments. The total  installed capacity is 447 MW, of which the  German share is 224 and the Swiss 223 MW.  Hydro Scheme    Schluchsee (1)  The Schluchsee hydro scheme in the Black Forest is designed for an ultimate capacity of approximately 400 MW. When fully developed it will use the 1,970 ft. head between the Schluchsee lake and the River Rhine at Waldshut, a distance of 12 miles. The work was planned in three stages. Stage one included the damming of the Schluchsee, creation of a reservoir of 108 million tons capacity, a.nd the huildi ng of a pumpedr-storage station at H&#228;usern for a head of 660 ft. Stage two was the building of a pumped-storage station at Witznau for a head of 930 ft. Stage three, which is still projected, is the building of a pumped- storage station at Waldshut for a head of 380 ft. Below H&#228;usern and Witznau generating stations there are two reservoirs of 1.3 and 4.5 million tons capacity respectively, to . serve as daily and weekly storage basins.  In 1929 construction was begun on the first  stage (Hausern)and on a provisional compensat-  ing station at Eichholz. This work was completed  in 1933, the installed capacity of the  generating plant at Hauserh being 104 MW.  and at Eichholz 30 MW. In 1938 construction  was begun on the second stage (Witznau), the  intention being to close down Eichholz when  this was completed. It is believed that this  work was finished in 1942, the installed  capacity of the generating plant at Witznau  being approximately 176 MW, and the total for  the scheme as then developed 280 MW. The  scheme provides for maximum output in the  winter months, and is designed to compensate  for the reduced output of the Upper Rhine  stations when the Alpine water supplies are  frozen. The projected pumped-storage station,  which has yet to be built at Waldshut, is  planned to have a capacity of 100 MW.  Substation     Tiengen  (-)  The precise position of this important sub-  station is unknown. It is the main collecting  point for the surplus output of the Upper  Rhine and Schluchsee water-power scheme, and  is also the terminus of the 380/220 kV long-  distance line connecting the hydro-electric  stations of the Upper Rhine and Vorarlberg  to the Ruhr industrial area via Herbertingen,  Hoheneck, Rheinau, Kelsterbach, Koblenz, and  Brauweiler substations, a distance by this  route of 360 miles. Three 110 kV lines  connect to Albbruck-Dogern, and two connect  possibly to Klingau, two to H&#228;usern power  station, and two possibly to Berau switching  station./ </PublicUtilityServices>

		<EngineeringandArmaments> Bruninghaus A. G.    Werdohl   (2)   The Stahlwerke Bruninghaus A. G. are important   producers of steel springs, in particular for   railway rolling-stock. This company, which is   a subsidiary of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A. G.   of Dusseldorf, employed some 1 500 workers   before the war, but is now thought to have   been considerably enlarged. A recent, report   states that these works are one of the three   most important suppliers of these products,   the others being the Hoesch plant at Hohen-   limburg and Dittmann-N.uhaus at Herbede. These   three factories are believed to supply the   German railways with practically their entire   requirements of springs. Thomee A. G.    Werdohl   (3)   Friedrich Thomee A.

		<Description> Wilhelmshaven lies on the North Sea coast at the mouth'of the small river Jade which flows into the sea a few milesWest of the Weser. It is 40 miles North-west of Bremen andis at the end of a branch railway from Bremen via Oldenburg.It is the Eastern terminus of the Ems-Jade Canal and thus hasaccess to the Dortmund-Ems Canal system. Wilhelmshaven is oneof Germany's largest naval bases and is the headquarters-ofthe North Sea Western Group and North Sea Coastal Defence Commands,The naval shipbuilding yards of Wilhelmshaven (the KriegsmarineWerft)have built many famous German warships, including the35,000 ton battle-cruiser Tirpitz. In the past few years,however, the port has chiefly concentrated on the building ofsubmarines, mainly of the 500-ton class. The yards at Wilhelmshavenalso undertake the repair and maintenance of E-boats and otherlight craft of a similar type. There are a number of oil-storagedepots without the port area, described below under Liquid Fuels,but apart from the one firm listed under Engineering and Armaments,Wilhelmshaven contains no other industries of importance; </Description>
		<Transportation> Port Area      Wilhelmshaven (2)   Wilhelmshaven has an extensive system of   docks which extend for 5 miles along the   Northern shore of the Jade Busen, the large   bay at the mouth of the river Jade. These   docks are all enclosed and are entered   through three lock gates at the Eastern end.   The dock systemis in course of expansion   to the Northwards.   The yards of the Kriegsmarine Werft are   situated in the Bau-Hafen which lies to the   East of the town. It is the innermost of   the harbours and has access to the sea via   the Ausr&#252;stungshafen.   The Grosser-Hafen is the chief coaling and   nnwerni port and lies immediately South   of the town. It includes extensive quay   and loading facilities, oil-storage plants,   and rail sidings. Immediately to the West   is the Zwischen-Hafen which contains one   large and two small floating docks. The main   coal-loading quays are in the Zwischen-Hafen.   Further West is the West-Hafen which includes   the yards of the Deutsche Werke A.G. On the   long sea-wall which divides the main docks   from the Jade Busen are a number of oil-storage   installations and the seaplane base which is   mentioned below under F Air craft and Aero Engines'.   The Ems-Jade Canal enters the port from the   West, passes through the Kanal-Hafen (a   channel with loading facilities which extends   along the landward side of the dock system), and   terminates in the Grosser-Hafen.   In the last few years reclamation work has been   in progress immediately to the North-east, of the   main port area where the coastline curves round   to the Nortnw'a, and it is reported that a new   dock, outer port, and uthor harbour installations   are in process of construction./ </Transportation>

		<LiquidFuelsandSubstitutes>   Oil Storage Depots   Wilhelmshaven (3)    There are numerous oil-storage depots    in the port area, the principal group of    which is on the sea wall which divides    the main dock system from the Jade Busen.    These tanks have an estimated total    capacity of 127,000 tons. There are other    tanks alongside the Grosser Hafen, in .    the area of the naval dockyard in the Bau    Hafen, and in the Verbindungshafen area.    The estimated total storage capacity of    these tanks is 44,000 tons. It is not known    to what extent the storage facilities are    being utilized. </LiquidFuelsandSubstitutes>
		<AircraftandAero-Engines>   Seaplane Base    Grosser-Hafen (3)    The Jade Busen serves as a seaplane alighting    zone. The buildings of the seaplane base    are built on the sea wall enclosing the    Grosser-Hafen. </AircraftandAero-Engines>
		<Shipbuilding>   Kriegsmarine Werft   Bau-Hafen   (1+)    The yards of the Kriegsmarine Werft are    at the Western end of the Bau-Hafen. Before    the war this highly-important shipbuilding    centre was one of the principal naval yards    for the construction of the German capital    ships. Among many famous vessels built    in these yards were the 35,000 ton battle-    cruiser "Tirpitz", sister ship of the    "Bismarck", the 26,000 ton battle-cruiser    "Schamhorst", and the two 10,000 ton    pocket-battleships "Graf Spee&#8221; and'Admiral    Scheer". Since the outbreak of war the    Marine Werft has been almost completely    turned over to the production of submarines,    chiefly of the 500-ton class.    There are six graving docks, of between JdO    and 630 feet long, and two building slipways    of 500 feet length. The yards are capable    of building up to 12 submarines simultaneously.

		<Description>  Wismar lies on the Baltic coast 35 miles East of Lubeck. It is at the end of a branch railway connecting with the main line from Lubeck to Rostock. It is a market centre for the neighbouring agricultural district. The chief industrial importance of Wismar is now due to the assembly plant of the Norddeutsche Dornier Werke aircraft concern, which is described below. There is also a large firm of railway-wagon builders. The shipbuilding industry is also represented, and there are other minor general engineering works./ </Description>

		<PublicUtilityServices> Herdecke Hydro Scheme   The Herdecke hydro scheme is based upon the   Hei^jsteysee, an artificial reservoir created by   damming the river Ruhr below its confluence with   the Lenne, and consists of 3 hydro-electric stations   and an important substation. The scheme has an   installed capacity of 146 MV. and is owned by the   Rheinisch-7/estfalisches Elektrizit&#228;tswerk A.G-. (RWE.)   E: sen. Her^stey I &amp; II Power Stations.   Hengsteysee   (3)   These two power stations are part of the Herdecke   Hydro scheme.   Hei^stey I, a flow station of 3 MW. capacity, is on   the weir at the end of the reservoir. Hengstey II, a   si mil ar station also of 3 MW. capacity, is on the   river Ruhr a mile below Hengstey I, from which it is   controlled. Both stations are of local importance   only. Koepchenwerk      Hengsteysee   (1)   Thi s is the third and by far the most important   of the stations which comprise the Herdecke hydro   scheme.   The Koepchenwerk is a punped-storage station of   12J0 MW. capacity)it is situated on the North bank   of the Hengsteysee, 6 miles E.S.E. of Witten. 540   feet above the station is the upper storage reservoir,   a smell er reservoir which is filled with water from   the lower reservoir by pumps situated in the generator   hall below. Four large pipe lines arranged in pairs   connect the upper reservoir with the station; these   made a conspicuous landmark but since the war have   been heavily camouflaged.WITTEN (oontd)  In the power house are 4 turbines, 4 alternators, and. 4  pumps. During low-consumption periods on the R.W.E  grid, the punps, operated by the alternators, replenish  the upper reservoir The station is for peak load  'nd emergency use; its great importance lies in that  when the upper reservoir is full, it can produce up  to 140 MW. almost instantaneously.   Substation         (4)  The substation is adjacent to the power station;  it has been developed since the war into a key  switching station for the Ruhr industrial area,  seconi in importance only to Brauweiler  The station was designed for eight 220-kV lines and  two1lO-kV lines Single-circuit 220-kV lines go to  Leithe via Hattingen, Gersteinwerk (Stodkm), Brauweiler,  Kruckel; double-circuit lines to Letmathe and Kreuztal  No definite information is available about the 110kV  lines; connections possibly go to the Cunowerk and  Hattingen stations.

		<Description>  Wittenberg is on the river Elbe and on the main railway line from Berlin to Halle. A branch line leads from Wittenberg Westwards to Rosslau, and a second line South-eastwards to Uebigau. The most important industry in Wittenberg itself is now the aircraft works mentioned below. The large fertilizer and chemical plant at Piesteritz, 5 miles from Wittenberg, is dealt with separately under the heading Piesteritz. Included in the list below is the nitro-cellulose plant at Reinsdorf 2 miles to the North-west. The other industries of Wittenberg are of no great size and include a chocolate factory, several slipper manufacturers, a number of small chemical works and engineering plants, and a margarine factory at Pratau, 3 miles to the South- west. </Description>

		<ChemicalsandExplosives>   Sprengstoff A.G.Reinsdorf   (2)    This factory is operated by the Westfalische    Anhaitische Sprengstoff A. G. During the    last war it manufactured almost the whole    range of military explosives, including    T. N. T. , nitrocellulose, picric acid, nitro-    glycerine, dynamite, and propellant powders.    There is a certain amount of ground inform-    ation regarding its present activities,    which is fortunately supplemented by ex-    cellent air photographs, dated May, 1943'    /The   WITTENBERG (contd. )    Sprengstoff A. G (contd.)    The present lay-out of the plant agrees    reasonably well with its ground plan at    the end of the last war, with the    significant difference that the T. N. T,    manufacturing unit has been removed.    The nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine    plants do not appear to have been much    altered, and there appears to be some    capacity for the manufacture of finished    propellant powders. In 1938 it was    reported that the Reinsdorf factory    produced 15,000 tons of nitro-cellulose    per annum, which is a little below the    estimate of capacity made by the Armistice    Commission in 1919. Examination of air    photographs taken in May, 1943, suggests    that the nitrocellulose capacity might    be- about 25,000 tons per annum at the    present time. Nitroglycerine, or    diglycoldinitrate, plant appears to be    installed, and the capacity may be very    roughly estimated at about 6,000 tons    per annum.-</ChemicalsandExplosives>
